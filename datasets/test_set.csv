ARXU3FESTWMJJ,B00CI3R71C,"Mary Jo Sminkey ""15 years of Amazon Reviews!""","[14, 16]","I've only had this camera for a couple days so this review is based on some quick observations but so far I've been very satisfied with this camera. It's my first Olympus, having previously used a Panasonic Lumix and a Sony NEX, as well as various Canon SLRs. Both the Lumix and Sony were lacking in some areas such as indoor performance and sports (fast autofocus) so I decided to invest in this camera with hopes of having something that truly could replace my SLR in most situations.So far, I've been hugely impressed! Out of the box, the camera was set to a default auto white balance that was a lot warmer than I prefer, so I had to dig through the menus to figure out how to correct this but once I found that, I got indoor shots that were really nice. The internal image stabilization did a very nice job and gave me pretty sharp photos considering the very low light I was testing in. Score one for the Olympus.Next I went outdoors to play around with some action shots with my dogs. I was using the 14-150mm lens, and tried first the Sports mode, but didn't get particularly good results on that, so moved to Aperture priority, set the f-stop to the lowest possible and then set the focus to auto-tracking and as a result I got much nicer results! I still don't think it's ever going to beat my Canon SLR in this area, certainly not with my f/2.8 L lens, as particularly if your subject moves quickly around in the frame it will take some time to find them again, but compared to other mirrorless cameras which are all but useless for action shots, this one was a HUGE improvement. A tougher test will be taking it indoors with one of the prime lenses and seeing if I can shoot something like a basketball game, but based on my observations so far I think I'm going to get some decent results with a little practice.The built-in flash is about what you would expect. I'm disappointed that Olympus does not incorporate a neat feature that Sony does, that allows you to manually pull the flash back to bounce it. The design looks like it could incorporate it, and makes it far more usable. But still good in a pinch and particularly useful to pair with an external flash.The VF-4 viewfinder is amazing! It blows away anything else I've ever used on a non-SLR camera, so big and bright and I had no problems using it even with glasses. At one point though it stopped working when I put my eye up to it and I had to turn the camera off for it to start detecting it again. Hope this isn't going to be a common issue. I do wish it was built in though so I could use it along with an attached flash. Since it's not, it would have been nice if it included a carrying case.The build quality of this camera is excellent, it has a very solid feel, but it is a bit heavier than other mirrorless cameras I have used and I can tell I would start to have some hand fatigue trying to grip it, particularly with any of the larger lenses that I would like to use, and even more so with an attached flash like the FL-600R. I expect I will be looking into adding a grip attachment as a result. The silver and black style that I got is really eye-catching with its retro appearance. Definitely one of the more attractive cameras in this range I've had the opportunity to hold.One of the big improvements with this camera over the previous model is being able to customize the buttons and dials for your own preferences. I've only just started playing with this, but it's a fantastic feature that any serious photographer is going to get a lot of use out of. This alone makes this camera worth choosing over other similar models. I also appreciated that the screen is a touchscreen versus the Sony NEX which is not. However the Sony did tilt up 180 degrees making it excellent for taking self portraits, something as a single person I did really love. No such feature on this camera, but it does offer better tilt options for working behind the camera.As far as the camera modes, there's a lot of stuff to play with. I've not yet worked with the WIFI but am looking forward to seeing how much easier it will be to take photos and post them to Facebook versus having to copy them to my computer first. It looks like it only works with Smartphones though, I would have liked the ability to create a connection to the camera from my desktop to transfer photos over the home network, as some iOS apps can do, but seems like it's fairly limited. You can use the Wifi to add Geotagging from the smartphone, but would be easier to just have that built into the camera in the first place. The Photostory mode is fun to play with but would like to be able to use photos I've already taken to put one together, I don't seem to be able to do that. Also disappointed with the Panorama mode, once you have used a Sony which stitches the photos together on the camera in seconds, it's hard to be happy with a really bare bones panorama mode like this one. It really doesn't seem to add anything over what you can do just manually taking photos and stitching them together later in software. Things like Art Filters really aren't features I'd tend to use a whole lot since I prefer to do that kind of thing in post-processing. There are some features this camera includes though that none of the other ones I've owned have that I look forward to trying, like the ability to do time-lapse photography.I'll have more to add as I get more experience with this camera, but so far I'm pretty impressed with it, obviously there are always little things I would want to tweak or improve but this is still a camera worthy of 5-stars as a best of breed in its category. The fast auto-focus alone makes is far more usable for a wide range of applications that other mirrorless systems fail at handling. It's not cheap, but you definitely are getting what you pay for with this one.UPDATE: SO I've had the camera now for a few months and have some additional comments. First, while the autofocus is definitely better than other mirrorless cameras I've had it's still not a match for a good SLR and fast lens when it comes to tracking fast moving subjects. I often shoot dog sports like agility and dog disc and this camera simply is not able to handle these well enough to substitute for my SLR and f/2.8 L lens. Not surprising of course, but given that a lot of attention is given to the autofocus improvements in this camera this is important to note. However, it still is a good enough improvement to handle less challenging sports like my nephews playing soccer.The wifi is a bit of a disappointment. What I really want is a camera that can upload images directly to social media sites, but for this camera, you need to first connect your device to the camera which is kind of tedious to do since it involves enabling the connection on the camera and switching the wifi on the phone, then you copy the photos over, then switch the wifi back to your local network, and then uploading to the social media site(s). Unless I'm somewhere other than at home or where I have a laptop, it's so cumbersome as to not be worth using in most cases. Even when I'm not at home, I'd just as soon use my card reader for my iPad to just pop in the SD card and copy the photos that way. So if this is a deciding factor for you in buying this camera, I'd say don't bother. Of more use is the ability to remotely trigger the camera with your phone which is certainly useful but could certainly be accomplished in other ways.The viewfinder continues to impress. I haven't had any further issues with it not working properly, so that issue seems to have been an anomaly. Whenever I give my camera to someone else to use, they always comment on the viewfinder and want to know about the camera because of how nice it is to have both a viewfinder and LCD option.

It's my first Olympus, having previously used a Panasonic Lumix and a Sony NEX, as well as various Canon SLRs. Both the Lumix and Sony were lacking in some areas such as indoor performance and sports (fast autofocus) so I decided to invest in this camera with hopes of having something that truly could replace my SLR in most situations.So far, I've been hugely impressed! Out of the box, the camera was set to a default auto white balance that was a lot warmer than I prefer, so I had to dig through the menus to figure out how to correct this but once I found that, I got indoor shots that were really nice. The internal image stabilization did a very nice job and gave me pretty sharp photos considering the very low light I was testing in. Score one for the Olympus.Next I went outdoors to play around with some action shots with my dogs. I was using the 14-150mm lens, and tried first the Sports mode, but didn't get particularly good results on that, so moved to Aperture priority, set the f-stop to the lowest possible and then set the focus to auto-tracking and as a result I got much nicer results! I still don't think it's ever going to beat my Canon SLR in this area, certainly not with my f/2.8 L lens, as particularly if your subject moves quickly around in the frame it will take some time to find them again, but compared to other mirrorless cameras which are all but useless for action shots, this one was a HUGE improvement. A tougher test will be taking it indoors with one of the prime lenses and seeing if I can shoot something like a basketball game, but based on my observations so far I think I'm going to get some decent results with a little practice.The built-in flash is about what you would expect. I'm disappointed that Olympus does not incorporate a neat feature that Sony does, that allows you to manually pull the flash back to bounce it. The design looks like it could incorporate it, and makes it far more usable. But still good in a pinch and particularly useful to pair with an external flash.The VF-4 viewfinder is amazing! It blows away anything else I've ever used on a non-SLR camera, so big and bright and I had no problems using it even with glasses. At one point though it stopped working when I put my eye up to it and I had to turn the camera off for it to start detecting it again. Hope this isn't going to be a common issue. I do wish it was built in though so I could use it along with an attached flash. Since it's not, it would have been nice if it included a carrying case.The build quality of this camera is excellent, it has a very solid feel, but it is a bit heavier than other mirrorless cameras I have used and I can tell I would start to have some hand fatigue trying to grip it, particularly with any of the larger lenses that I would like to use, and even more so with an attached flash like the FL-600R. I expect I will be looking into adding a grip attachment as a result. The silver and black style that I got is really eye-catching with its retro appearance. Definitely one of the more attractive cameras in this range I've had the opportunity to hold.One of the big improvements with this camera over the previous model is being able to customize the buttons and dials for your own preferences. I've only just started playing with this, but it's a fantastic feature that any serious photographer is going to get a lot of use out of. This alone makes this camera worth choosing over other similar models. I also appreciated that the screen is a touchscreen versus the Sony NEX which is not. However the Sony did tilt up 180 degrees making it excellent for taking self portraits, something as a single person I did really love. No such feature on this camera, but it does offer better tilt options for working behind the camera.As far as the camera modes, there's a lot of stuff to play with. I've not yet worked with the WIFI but am looking forward to seeing how much easier it will be to take photos and post them to Facebook versus having to copy them to my computer first. It looks like it only works with Smartphones though, I would have liked the ability to create a connection to the camera from my desktop to transfer photos over the home network, as some iOS apps can do, but seems like it's fairly limited. You can use the Wifi to add Geotagging from the smartphone, but would be easier to just have that built into the camera in the first place. The Photostory mode is fun to play with but would like to be able to use photos I've already taken to put one together, I don't seem to be able to do that. Also disappointed with the Panorama mode, once you have used a Sony which stitches the photos together on the camera in seconds, it's hard to be happy with a really bare bones panorama mode like this one. It really doesn't seem to add anything over what you can do just manually taking photos and stitching them together later in software. Things like Art Filters really aren't features I'd tend to use a whole lot since I prefer to do that kind of thing in post-processing. There are some features this camera includes though that none of the other ones I've owned have that I look forward to trying, like the ability to do time-lapse photography.I'll have more to add as I get more experience with this camera, but so far I'm pretty impressed with it, obviously there are always little things I would want to tweak or improve but this is still a camera worthy of 5-stars as a best of breed in its category. The fast auto-focus alone makes is far more usable for a wide range of applications that other mirrorless systems fail at handling. It's not cheap, but you definitely are getting what you pay for with this one.UPDATE: SO I've had the camera now for a few months and have some additional comments. First, while the autofocus is definitely better than other mirrorless cameras I've had it's still not a match for a good SLR and fast lens when it comes to tracking fast moving subjects. I often shoot dog sports like agility and dog disc and this camera simply is not able to handle these well enough to substitute for my SLR and f/2.8 L lens. Not surprising of course, but given that a lot of attention is given to the autofocus improvements in this camera this is important to note. However, it still is a good enough improvement to handle less challenging sports like my nephews playing soccer.The wifi is a bit of a disappointment. What I really want is a camera that can upload images directly to social media sites, but for this camera, you need to first connect your device to the camera which is kind of tedious to do since it involves enabling the connection on the camera and switching the wifi on the phone, then you copy the photos over, then switch the wifi back to your local network, and then uploading to the social media site(s). Unless I'm somewhere other than at home or where I have a laptop, it's so cumbersome as to not be worth using in most cases. Even when I'm not at home, I'd just as soon use my card reader for my iPad to just pop in the SD card and copy the photos that way. So if this is a deciding factor for you in buying this camera, I'd say don't bother. Of more use is the ability to remotely trigger the camera with your phone which is certainly useful but could certainly be accomplished in other ways.The viewfinder continues to impress. I haven't had any further issues with it not working properly, so that issue seems to have been an anomaly. Whenever I give my camera to someone else to use, they always comment on the viewfinder and want to know about the camera because of how nice it is to have both a viewfinder and LCD option. I do a lot of shooting outside and in bright sun particularly it's just essential to have. The downside of course is that since it's not built in, you can't easily use both the viewfinder and a flash, unless you use the flash off-camera. I need to learn how to do this, because it does drive me nuts that I have to take the viewfinder off to use the flash, I really am not sure why they just didn't build it into the camera as with the OM-D.One issue we did run into was when I handed my camera to someone else to take a photo and they touched a corner of the LCD which zoomed in the view to an extreme closeup, which took us awhile to figure out how to turn it back off.

In my way of thinking, you can never have too many external battery packs. As a friend is fond of quoting: &#34;ABC - Always Be Charging&#34;. While there are a few things that I could put down as &#34;disadvantages&#34; to the Maxboost, it keeps coming back to one thing for me... this battery has some serious power reserves. I could go out into the desert for a week with my iPhone and this battery, and I wouldn't care if I never found an outlet until I returned.At 15000mAh, this is the largest battery pack I own. It's got a bit of heft to it, such that you wouldn't forget you had it in your pocket or purse. But if you had it in a go-pack or backpack when you're going through your day, it'd be fine. It comes with two output ports at 1.0A and 2.1A. Technically, you could charge two phones or a phone and a tablet at the same time. The input to the unit for recharging comes from a normal micro USB cord. The storage bag (black velvet) comes with the USB cord and adapter plugs for micro USB, mini USB, and the 30-pin Apple connector. If you needed a lightning connector for an Apple device, you'd have to bring your own. Finally, there's a built-in flashlight that turns on when you click the power button twice. You may never need it, but it's there.In terms of recharging speed... When charging my iPhone 4, I was getting more than 1% of recharge per minute, which is my general measuring standard. When done charging, I found that I had only gone through 9 - 10% of the battery reserve. I could easily get seven or eight iPhone recharges on this battery! Charging my iPad was more of a strain on the unit, and it was taking about an hour for each 10% of charge. If my iPad was completely drained, I'd look at the battery to give me one recharge. I'd probably do better to plug in the battery while I use the iPad, and let it slow down the rate of iPad battery drain so I get more usage time instead of waiting half a day to get a fully repowered iPad.On the battery charging times... It took most of the day to take the battery unit back up to 100% capacity. It didn't seem to matter whether I had it plugged into a USB port or into a power plug adapter. It's definitely not fast, and it seems to slow down the closer you get to 100%. I would plan on recharging it overnight when you don't think you'll be needing it. Slow? Yes... but the amount of power it gives me when it *is* completely charged makes that an OK tradeoff for me.You could get REAL picky and say that the black glossy cover on the unit attracts fingerprints way too easily. I say that's what shirts are for... to wipe off fingerprints. I can't get overly excited or bothered over smudges when compared to what the battery can actually do (which is lots!)If I wasn't so enamoured over the amount of backup power and number of recharges I get with the Maxboost, I *might* consider making this a four-star rating.

It feels nice in my hands and it does take good video in full Hi-def. There is even a built-in LED flash light that helps you take good video and pictures in pitch dark.If you do not enable the built-in flashlight your videos tends to be grainy as most of the reviewers here has pointed out. Using the Built-in flash LED Light has a bug when you try to get too close to the subject. The video blanks out (Gets recorded that way too) as it tries to protect the CCD sensor due to bright light condition. This seems like a glaring bug seen only in pitch dark conditions. However, There is a low light mode but you got to fiddle with the manual settings to avoid that condition mentioned above. Having said, do not get alarmed by this comment. It still takes superb video under low light conditions compared to most other camcorders that I have come across.The CX580 does allow you to take decent quality still images while you are recording videos simultaneously but if you select the maximum resolution of video capture it refuses to take still images simultaneously. I consider this a limitation on the product.The beauty of this camcorder is its size and fairly large embedded memory. Gone are the days when you need to carry MiniDV tapes and the tape mechanical noises getting into the tape as you record video. The built-in memory can also be supplemented with a SDHC card and while the recording to the SDHC card is not seamless it still gives you the chance to switch to SDHC card in a snap.The LCD is super crisp and clear. The colors are vivid and accurate even in bright conditions. The touch screen is not super sensitive but gets the job done. The built-in speaker is loud enough for most needs. You can even attach external mic or headphone connectivity for private viewing pleasure.The optically stabilized lens does record excellent video in bright light conditions, Perfect for those outdoor videos and birthday parties. You can switch on the Built-in LED flashlight and take video in poorly lit rooms to compensate for the low light conditions. The video reproduction is faithful in terms of color and saturation but seemed slightly washed out but thankfully more 'true color' than other camcorders I have owned. It is trade off that I am willing to accept.If you purchase an optional cableUSB Adapter Cable for SONY 2010 Handycam camcorder direct copy VMCUAM1you can transfer the contents of the embedded 32GB memory on to a FAT32 formatted external HDD without the use of a PC which can come handy in situations wherein you ran out of internal embedded 32GB memory and do not wish to buy additional SDHC cards.

Please bear it in mind that this process requires you to have AC power as the camcorder will refuse to connect to an external hard drive unless you have AC power. While this feature is fully usable I wished it supported NTFS formatted external hard drives and did not need the AC power to transfer contents to external hard drive.The charging process can be done via USB from what I observed it charges slowly. For about 10 mins of charging it gives you 5 mins of battery charge. But the included power adapter and USB extension cable contraption works too but still takes sometime for a full charge.The included software is good enough for file transfer and some basic video editing. I personally would use professional video editing software to get best results. For most users of this product the included software is good enough for file transfer to PC. There are plenty of creative options built right into the camcorder for basic editing and I find them plenty enough for basic editing functions.Having said, I wish I could rate this camcorder with full five stars but I cannot.

A39LRLKACX89IP,B0085VB8GQ,Courtland J. Carpenter,"[0, 1]","In 2004, shortly after I became re-employed in a good position, it was time to replace my computer system.  In the summer of 1998 I had bought a Dell XPS R400 Pentium 4 computer system.  It had a high quality Turtle Beach sound card and came with a 2.1 Altek Lansing sound system.  The sound was good, but the card was always better than the speakers I think.  I had coveted some Klipsch 4.1 or 5.1 systems but they were far too expensive at the time.  In 2004 I purchased a Dell XPS super system with the best of everything for the time.  I was still staying with my parents so my space was not very large, and so I decided to get a Klipsch 2.1 system to go with the new computer.  Dell didn't offer it, so I bought it separately.  The sound was great, I experimented with 3D effects and other sounds and both highs, lows and separation was first rate.  So in late 2009 when something was going bad with the replacement system, I upgraded to an Alienware (still by Dell) desktop, but kept the speakers from the old system, they in fact sounded even better, with the sound blaster platinum series card.  Before it was logistics of the room, but now it was practicality, who wants to deal with 5.1, 6.1, 7.1 8.1 etc. sound systems unless you have professionals wire them and create a theater room.  I've noticed now that 2.1 speaker systems, which were somewhat hard to find a few years back, have regained popularity.The Boston Acoustics 2.1 system here now speaks to that and adds something new to the party!  I'm not using this for a computer but, to enhance my flat screen TV.  You don't often get the full range of sound out of a flat screen system, in fact sometimes the harmonics on mine resonate with the cabinet, and the sound distorts.  This system takes care of that problem and gives a full, rich sound that now fills the room.  My high def TV was a cheap one so no optical input, and the best option was a mini-pin on the TV output end, and two RCA jacks on the speaker system inputs.  This is totally analog to the speakers so the sound is probably not the best it can be, but it's all I can do for now.  In fact, I had my friend connect with his Android Smart Phone via Blue Tooth, and the country music he played was a lot fuller than the TV output, but then that connection is a digital transfer.  The instructions are clear and the thing is easy to hook up as long as you can tell an output from an input.  Beware, cheaper TV's may have a lot of inputs and few outputs.  Mine has 3 HDMI's some USB's, some RCA's, some Component RCA type, but there were few outputs, and it was lacking the optical output, which would have been the best.I didn't like the drilling hole options in my plaster wall or hardwood paneling, so I ordered a generic pair of stands made for the satellite speakers.  Right now they just lay on the table on either side of the TV, still they give out very good, very clean highs and midrange. The colored lights on the control indicator give you a quick view of your mode, so it only takes seconds to switch from TV to Smart Phone, or any Blue Tooth MP3 player. Unless you have a wire fetish, this system can nearly mimic all the sound from those multi-count speaker systems.  This is the kind of thing that I think would make a good gift for someone, reason being I'm not sure I'd have thought to buy this anytime soon, had I not gotten it through the Vine.  That is no indictment of the price, quality, or function of the system.  It's just something so new to me right now, I didn't know the tech existed to play music from a Smart Phone, to a home stereo, audiophile type system, that doubles as my home sound theater for the TV.  Once I hooked it up, I realized the function and value.  This means if you get it for friends or family, once they connect it up, they will be thanking you over and over.  Plus, you'll really enjoy movie night, or football Sunday at the folks place from now on!  Priced right for the quality and function, recommended improvement to your home theater on a budget upgrade.Update: I've had these for a few months right now, and I've not had problems with use or sound quality.  There is a slight delay for the sound to transfer, but this is more because of the way I had to set this up, (not using the optical cable) not the access speed. I've connected a number of streaming devices, channels, DVDs, CDs, Blu Rays, smart phones, and tablets, to play on this.

In the summer of 1998 I had bought a Dell XPS R400 Pentium 4 computer system. It had a high quality Turtle Beach sound card and came with a 2.1 Altek Lansing sound system. The sound was good, but the card was always better than the speakers I think. I had coveted some Klipsch 4.1 or 5.1 systems but they were far too expensive at the time. In 2004 I purchased a Dell XPS super system with the best of everything for the time. I was still staying with my parents so my space was not very large, and so I decided to get a Klipsch 2.1 system to go with the new computer. Dell didn't offer it, so I bought it separately. The sound was great, I experimented with 3D effects and other sounds and both highs, lows and separation was first rate. So in late 2009 when something was going bad with the replacement system, I upgraded to an Alienware (still by Dell) desktop, but kept the speakers from the old system, they in fact sounded even better, with the sound blaster platinum series card. Before it was logistics of the room, but now it was practicality, who wants to deal with 5.1, 6.1, 7.1 8.1 etc. sound systems unless you have professionals wire them and create a theater room. I've noticed now that 2.1 speaker systems, which were somewhat hard to find a few years back, have regained popularity.The Boston Acoustics 2.1 system here now speaks to that and adds something new to the party! I'm not using this for a computer but, to enhance my flat screen TV. You don't often get the full range of sound out of a flat screen system, in fact sometimes the harmonics on mine resonate with the cabinet, and the sound distorts. This system takes care of that problem and gives a full, rich sound that now fills the room. My high def TV was a cheap one so no optical input, and the best option was a mini-pin on the TV output end, and two RCA jacks on the speaker system inputs. This is totally analog to the speakers so the sound is probably not the best it can be, but it's all I can do for now. In fact, I had my friend connect with his Android Smart Phone via Blue Tooth, and the country music he played was a lot fuller than the TV output, but then that connection is a digital transfer. The instructions are clear and the thing is easy to hook up as long as you can tell an output from an input. Beware, cheaper TV's may have a lot of inputs and few outputs. Mine has 3 HDMI's some USB's, some RCA's, some Component RCA type, but there were few outputs, and it was lacking the optical output, which would have been the best.I didn't like the drilling hole options in my plaster wall or hardwood paneling, so I ordered a generic pair of stands made for the satellite speakers. Right now they just lay on the table on either side of the TV, still they give out very good, very clean highs and midrange. The colored lights on the control indicator give you a quick view of your mode, so it only takes seconds to switch from TV to Smart Phone, or any Blue Tooth MP3 player. Unless you have a wire fetish, this system can nearly mimic all the sound from those multi-count speaker systems. This is the kind of thing that I think would make a good gift for someone, reason being I'm not sure I'd have thought to buy this anytime soon, had I not gotten it through the Vine. That is no indictment of the price, quality, or function of the system. It's just something so new to me right now, I didn't know the tech existed to play music from a Smart Phone, to a home stereo, audiophile type system, that doubles as my home sound theater for the TV. Once I hooked it up, I realized the function and value. This means if you get it for friends or family, once they connect it up, they will be thanking you over and over. Plus, you'll really enjoy movie night, or football Sunday at the folks place from now on! Priced right for the quality and function, recommended improvement to your home theater on a budget upgrade.Update: I've had these for a few months right now, and I've not had problems with use or sound quality. There is a slight delay for the sound to transfer, but this is more because of the way I had to set this up, (not using the optical cable) not the access speed. I've connected a number of streaming devices, channels, DVDs, CDs, Blu Rays, smart phones, and tablets, to play on this. The bluetooth tech is really nice the way it seamlessly connects, and you get access while you sit to great sound. I do wish they would hurry up, and create custom speaker stands for the small mid-range and high note speakers. I bought some universal ones that are supposed to work on Boston Acoustics products, but they don't work on this one.

A2WPL6Y08K6ZQH,B00FSKQNEY,"Narut Ujnat ""Enthusiasm is contagious.""","[4, 5]","I have used a variety of Harmon Kardon products in the past and have usually been very impressed.  Here, I was offered the opportunity to review the Harmon Kardon Onyx speaker.11.  What's in the Box?:  You receive the speaker, which is surprisingly heavier than you would expect, plus a power brick, and some brief instructions for the speaker.2.  Aesthetic?:  The speaker I received to review was of the 'white' variation (there is a 'black' variation as well).  The speaker itself is extremely attractive as a design, with a nice metal ring that allows the speaker to sit on the speaker bottom and the ring (which has a nice plastic bumper on the bottom) which is set at a 45 degree angle towards the back.  The speaker has a nice cloth grill on the front which can be taken off quite easily (although I would think other than showing off the impressive cones and the like this would be unnecessary).  The rear of the unit has a leather ring going around the back.  In addition, there is a center subwoofer outlet (thoughtfully made with the Harmon Kardon name printed on the woofer cone) which is metal.  At the very bottom, there are outlets for the power brick.Overall, this is a very nice looking piece of equipment.  The speaker really does exude a quality build.  While the faux leather is an interesting choice, it is a neat touch.  To me this is a nice looking thing.  However, while this is portable, this is not the unit you would buy to take around to the beach or really anywhere outside.  This is apparently really designed to be a portable unit around the house, as this is far too nice (and expensive).3.  Use?:  Since the speaker is a fairly simple machine, it was not difficult to get this to work.  First off, I plugged in the power brick (which is in two pieces) to the unit (slides in to the designated slot easily), and then I turned the unit on.  The speaker has no buttons per se, rather there are touch buttons for power, volume and wi-fi.  To power on the device, you simply press the power button (on the right side) and the unit lights up to signify it is on).  The default connection is bluetooth (signified by the blue light) with wi-fi connections being off (designated by an orange light).  Once I verified the bluetooth was on, I grabbed my Iphone and turned on the bluetooth for the phone.  The phone immediately recognized the Onyx (which states it is Onyx in the bluetooth directory) and tried to connect.  The connection was made within a few seconds and was signified by a pleasant 'bump.'  From then I used my Music app and I was playing music easily.How is the sound?  Well, I certainly can discern good sound, but I am probably not an audiophile, as demanding as that might be.  I think the buds with the Apple products are pretty good, so use that as a guideline.  The sound is pretty darn good. However, it is clear that the speakers do need a bit of curing with some prolonged play to burn the speaker in.  After using this for some hours, I have found the sound to be quite good in a way that transcends that usual bluetooth speakers I have used before.  The speaker sure wants to get more volume, but the sound is pretty well balanced.  Once I got past the burn-in period, the speaker really had a nice, warm sound, albeit at a good volume (at least 1/4 of the way up on the Iphone).So, since sound is so objective, what about the other features?Upon turning the item on and connecting, I was directed to download the Harmon Kardon app, which I did do as directed.  The app supposedly makes it easier to use the speaker with the music already downloaded on your device.  Unfortunately, I was not all that impressed.  First off, the app is not intuitively obvious with some of the steps.  While I was able to play the music I wanted fairly easily, the app had some quirks (like not playing some songs immediately).  Also, I could not figure out whether it is even possible to turn the speaker on or off (it appears not possible).Battery life:  this appears to be at about 6 hours for use according to my experience.  I have found that the battery does not retain a charge for a real long time during non-use (meaning don't expect to leave this without the power brick for weeks and then use it).Overall:  This is certainly a very well made, nice quality speaker by Harmon Kardon.  The variety of connections (Airplay, Bluetooth, DLNA (have not used that yet) and the nature of this design make this a terrifically nice item.  Once I burned in the speaker, I was impressed by the sound which (depending on the source) was quite good and full.  Also, this item can really fill a room with sufficient volume.I am cognizant that this is an enormously expensive item.  At the price level currently, I am not sure this would be a high priority for me to purchase.  However, I am impressed with the overall quality, it would seem that the price point is more justifiable at a price around $350.Conclusions:  This speaker is impressive in many ways.  The look is really very nice.  I really love the 'white' theme and the steel ring.  It is artistic and a pleasure to look at.  Given the cost, that is an impediment to this thing really being a home-run.  But surely, I found this to be a triple.  I am enjoying the speaker and the convenience.++++++UpdateI finally got around to using the Wi-Fi function and Airplay with Itunes.  This process is not intuitive at all, and I had to visit the support page to download the PDF instructions (not the quick guide).  Once I did that, essentially you turn the device on and hold the wi-fi button for 5 seconds (discovery mode).  Using a laptop, you simply find the network listing the Onyx and connect.  Once you do this, you will load 192.168.1.1 and the speaker page will come up.  Load the desired network and password and you should hear a confirmation beep.  Then the device will log-off the speaker network and load the regular wireless network you use and you should be ready to go.  Using this with Airplay is simple.  In Itunes, this will simply show an icon next to the function buttons (play, etc) and you can connect the speaker.  Fantastic. Forget Bluetooth, this is FAR better.Once complaint.  I cannot understand why you cannot power the device on and off remotely unless I am missing something.  Please fix this if possible in a software update.

Unfortunately I do not understand what people are raving about? For portraits on my 5d mark2 I much prefer a simpleCanon EF 85mm f/1.8 USM Medium Telephoto Lens for Canon SLR Camerasfor less than half the price. However the lens that eventually replaced this wasCanon EF 100mm f/2.8L IS USM 1-to-1 Macro Lens for Canon Digital SLR Cameras, for about the same price. I really like tack sharp resolution and both of the lenses I kept do just that with a great Bokeh in my opinion. I think that this is probably just an old design, which just does not keep up with the nicer digital sensors. It may be OK on some smaller and older APS-C sensors, but I just do not like the sharpness, especially that it missed way too many times for me. I gave this lens as much time as I could, but in the end I am much happier with the other two lenses, which serve me very well. And in the end you could probably stop it down to F4 and I think the sharpness will get pretty good, but then why am I paying for an F2 which by the way 100mm macro does tack sharp at F/2.8 with beautiful Bokeh, but it is a much newer lens design.4/12/2012 Edit:Upon reading the comments here I have given this lens a few more chances. Here is what I have found:1. There was a user error and I was asking this lens to do what it was not designed to do. Namely I used it to close near it's MFD which it does poorly ( especially on my 5d m2 ).2. I was demanding exceptional sharpness wide open. Not on a $1000 lensBarring these two I find this lens a great choice for some situations. Namely if you want a lens similar to Canon 70-200 F/2.8 IS II, but with half the weight and half the size and black stealth vs white glare, I find this lens very useful. If I have to shoot in the dark at 2.0 I just accept the sharpness loss. In the day I use it between 2.8 and 4.0 and as long as I don't have to have the zoom it saves me lots of weight and size as well as it's much more stealthy. Yes the build quality is very good, but filter size sucks. Though I think the new 24-70 m2 will be the same size. So in conclusion this is a very old design and looses in many ways to the newer sexier designs.

A1K4SMWERIHTAS,B003ZHV70M,Macdonald Cory,"[1, 1]","I have been using the FinePix Real 3D camera for about three or five weeks and it is really fun taking pictures with it.  The Real 3D has a wide screen LCD screen which displays a 3D image when in 3D mode with no glasses. The camera has Aperture, Manual, and Program Mode controls. Aperture goes from f/3.7 to f/8; shutter speeds go 1/2 to 1/500 seconds. To adjust the controls one has to press the menu/ok button and then press aperture or whatever in the menu to make exposure adjustment; one has to do this for every exposure change which becomes a bit of a pain. The frustrating part of the system is the My FinePix Studio/See Here software. You can adjust 2D exposures and cropping, but not 3D. This became a problem when ordering prints. Since the 3D prints are printed in the 35mm format instead of the wide screen format of the camera's LCD viewscreen, the prints were cropped in all the wrong places (You can't make corrections for FujiFilm's 3D file, MPO., format in Photoshop). This can get very expensive. Luckly and belatedly, I discovered that the 3D images can be cropped in the camera with the ""Image Size"" setting ( ""L"" 4:3 1065 setting) and the ""Crop"" setting (I should have read the manual and fooled around with the buttons before deleting the images on my SD card!). The 3D images can be viewed on a non-3D monitor with those red/blue glasses or on a 3D monitor with those special 3D glasses. Since I don't have a 3D TV or a 3D monitor, I can't comment on the image quality on the big screen, but the prints are well exposed and sharp. The quality is much better than 3D 35mm cameras' final product which in my experience wasn't exposed well by the camera or printed well by the processor.Would I recommend this camera? Yes. I haven't use all of its capablities like making movies, macro and shooting two different 2D exposures at the same time, but it is fun to use.

What's more, your memories will be captured with stereo audio sound in movie mode.Two sets of lens that work in the same way as human eyes. Our ability to perceive depth comes from viewing an object along two different lines of sight. This phenomenon is called parallax. The FinePix REAL 3D W3 is fitted with two lenses to capture realistic images that are unchanged from how human eyes see them. Both optical 3x zoom lenses capture subjects beautifully, even from a distance. The camera's newly developed stainless steel frame maintains the optical axis with high precision.All these features are combined in a light, compact, stylish body. With its two 10 megapixel sensors, the FinePix REAL 3D W3 captures even the finest of details. The synchronized control of the two sensors and lenses prevents any inaccuracy between the two images and produces a perfectly matched pair of images which, when combined, produce a single image with a very natural sense of depth. Image data captured by the twin lens-CCD system is processed by the newly developed RP (REAL PHOTO) Processor 3D HD. The technology merges the left and right images into a single image. This processor is also the power behind 3D Auto--the function that lets even first-time users take stunning HD-quality images effortlessly. And not only can it shoot in spectacular 3D, but you can also switch to standard 2D mode and use it as a normal camera. There are even special features that allow you to use the fact that the camera has two lenses and two sensors and take two different photos at once. Super Intelligent Flash and Scene Position are featured to automatically make the optical settings to match your scene.Plus, you can see your 3D movies and photos with the naked eye.

These advanced 2D modes allow you to benefit from the two cameras independently with Dual Shooting modes taking two shots at the same time and capturing the same scene in different colors, at different zoom lengths and at different sensitivities.Tele/Wide Simultaneous ShootingZoom in on your subject and also take a wide-angle shot of the same scene at the same time. The twin-lens system lets you freely set the zoom magnification for one lens while the other is set to wide angle, letting you capture the exact same instant with totally different angles of view.* With Tele/Wide Simultaneous Shooting, the left lens can zoom while the right lens is fixed in a wide angle setting.2-Color Simultaneous ShootingChange the settings and with one press of the shutter, you can take two photos of the same scene with a different color tonality. Set one lens system to Standard and the other to the vivid colors of Chrome. You can also capture the scene in both Standard and vintage Black & White or shoot simultaneously with Chrome and Black & White. Fujifilm doubles your enjoyment of every moment.2-Sensitivity Simultaneous ShootingTake two photos of the same instant - one at high sensitivity and one at low sensitivity. For example, you can take panned shots of a moving subject at the exact same instant with different degrees of background motion blur. In dark scenes, you can prioritize blur reduction for one shot, and image quality for the other. For times when you are not sure which sensitivity setting is best, you can shoot the moment at two settings and later pick the image to keep during playback.Intuitive Interface & OperationIntroducing easy to navigate interface and smooth operation for a better 3D / 2D shooting experience.Design & InterfaceOne-hand grip slim design; featuring grip parts, this body delivers you the utmost grip comfort when shooting and opening the barrier with one hand.Sliding BarrierWith a sliding barrier protecting the lenses, the camera is designed for ease of operation.One-touch 3D/2D SwitchControl button for one-touch switching between 3D and 2D shooting and playbackMode DialSmooth mode dial control can easily be done when choosing for the right shooting mode.Slim BodyDesigned with the smart look, this compact slim body allows mobility and convenience.Playback FunctionFeaturing an innovative 3D viewing LCD monitor, you can playback the results both in 3D and 2D right on the spot.Micro Thumbnail ViewUp to 100 pictures can be viewed at a time in a 10x10 array of micro thumbnails.

Both optical 3x zoom lenses capture subjects beautifully, even from a distance. The camera's newly developed stainless steel frame maintains the optical axis with high precision.All these features are combined in a light, compact, stylish body. With its two 10 megapixel sensors, the FinePix REAL 3D W3 captures even the finest of details. The synchronized control of the two sensors and lenses prevents any inaccuracy between the two images and produces a perfectly matched pair of images which, when combined, produce a single image with a very natural sense of depth. Image data captured by the twin lens-CCD system is processed by the newly developed RP (REAL PHOTO) Processor 3D HD. The technology merges the left and right images into a single image. This processor is also the power behind 3D Auto--the function that lets even first-time users take stunning HD-quality images effortlessly. And not only can it shoot in spectacular 3D, but you can also switch to standard 2D mode and use it as a normal camera. There are even special features that allow you to use the fact that the camera has two lenses and two sensors and take two different photos at once. Super Intelligent Flash and Scene Position are featured to automatically make the optical settings to match your scene.Plus, you can see your 3D movies and photos with the naked eye. The large 3.5-inch LCD screen displays high-resolution, high-contrast 3D images and movies without the need for glasses. See it in all its glory with your own eyes. High Luminosity Mode displays images 1.5x brighter and reproduces color 1.8 x deeper, allowing you to enjoy clear, distinct and vivid images. Simply connect your W3 camera to a 3DTV using a HDMI cable and sit back and enjoy all your photos and home movies in amazing high definition 3D. Try out Fujifilm's 3D printing system which prints 3D images directly on to special lenticular sheets. The result is photos with spectacular depth, and memories preserved in beautiful 3D.FinePix REAL 3D Technology pioneers a new dimension in imagingFujinon Lens - Two Sets of Lens that Work in the Same Way as Human EyesOur ability to perceive depth comes from viewing an object along two different lines of sight. This phenomenon is called parallax. The FinePix REAL 3D W3 is fitted with dual lenses to capture realistic images that are unchanged from how human eyes see them. Both optical 3x zoom lenses capture subjects beautifully, even from a distance. The camera's newly developed stainless steel frame maintains the optical axis with high precision. All these features are combined in a light, compact, stylish body.3D CCD System - Natural Sense of Depth with Synchronized Control of Two CCDsWith its two 10 megapixel sensors, the FinePix Real 3D W3 captures even the finest of details. The synchronized control of the two sensors and lenses prevents any inaccuracy between the two images and produces a perfectly matched pair of images which, when combined, produce a single image with a very natural sense of depth.RP (REAL PHOTO) Processor - New REAL PHOTO Processor 3DHDImage data captured by the dual lens-CCD system is processed by the newly developed RP (REAL PHOTO) processor 3DHD. The technology merges the left and right images into a single image. This processor is also the power behind 3D Auto - the function that lets even first-time users take stunning HD-quality images effortlessly.Advanced 2D ModeWith two lenses and two sensors, the W3 camera is effectively two cameras in one. These advanced 2D modes allow you to benefit from the two cameras independently with Dual Shooting modes taking two shots at the same time and capturing the same scene in different colors, at different zoom lengths and at different sensitivities.Tele/Wide Simultaneous ShootingZoom in on your subject and also take a wide-angle shot of the same scene at the same time. The twin-lens system lets you freely set the zoom magnification for one lens while the other is set to wide angle, letting you capture the exact same instant with totally different angles of view.* With Tele/Wide Simultaneous Shooting, the left lens can zoom while the right lens is fixed in a wide angle setting.2-Color Simultaneous ShootingChange the settings and with one press of the shutter, you can take two photos of the same scene with a different color tonality. Set one lens system to Standard and the other to the vivid colors of Chrome. You can also capture the scene in both Standard and vintage Black & White or shoot simultaneously with Chrome and Black & White. Fujifilm doubles your enjoyment of every moment.2-Sensitivity Simultaneous ShootingTake two photos of the same instant - one at high sensitivity and one at low sensitivity. For example, you can take panned shots of a moving subject at the exact same instant with different degrees of background motion blur. In dark scenes, you can prioritize blur reduction for one shot, and image quality for the other. For times when you are not sure which sensitivity setting is best, you can shoot the moment at two settings and later pick the image to keep during playback.Intuitive Interface & OperationIntroducing easy to navigate interface and smooth operation for a better 3D / 2D shooting experience.Design & InterfaceOne-hand grip slim design; featuring grip parts, this body delivers you the utmost grip comfort when shooting and opening the barrier with one hand.Sliding BarrierWith a sliding barrier protecting the lenses, the camera is designed for ease of operation.One-touch 3D/2D SwitchControl button for one-touch switching between 3D and 2D shooting and playbackMode DialSmooth mode dial control can easily be done when choosing for the right shooting mode.Slim BodyDesigned with the smart look, this compact slim body allows mobility and convenience.Playback FunctionFeaturing an innovative 3D viewing LCD monitor, you can playback the results both in 3D and 2D right on the spot.Micro Thumbnail ViewUp to 100 pictures can be viewed at a time in a 10x10 array of micro thumbnails. Convenient for smooth and comfortable playback.SlideshowBring your photos to life! Close-ups of detected faces are shown in slideshow style.3D File FormatFor 3D image recording, the FinePix REAL 3D system adopts the MP format for stills and 3D-AVI format for movies. MP format is the ""multi-picture format"" standardized by CIPA. FinePix REAL 3D W3 can also simultaneously record still images in both MP format (3D) and JPEG (2D). 3D-AVI adopts the widely used AVI multimedia container format. Adoption of these formats enables 2D playback of recorded images on the user's current personal computer.SD/SDHC Memory Card SlotThe versatile card slot is compatible with SD and high-capacity Secure Digital (SDHC) memory cards.Expanded World of ""View 3D""3D excitement begins the moment you see the stunning form and builds as you experience the innovative interface.3.5-inch Widescreen 3D LCD MonitorSee your 3D movies and photos with the naked eye The large 3.5-inch LCD screen displays high-resolution, high-contrast 3D images and movies without the need for glasses.

New firmware was released January 23rd, and it needed to be put onto the Seagate drive before the drive could communicate with iOS devices.OK, I went through all of the steps involved in downloading the firmware update, transferring it to the Seagate drive, and rebooting the drive precisely so that the .bin file would update. Then I started all over again with the iPhone app, but it still asked me to run a firmware update. It also asked me to connect to the Seagate Wi-fi network. All right, now I've connected to the Seagate wi-fi network, but none of the initial autorun ""Welcome to Seagate"" happens, because apparently the firmware update stops all of that.Once the drive is recognized (by my iPhone), and the wi-fi is protected (by my iPhone), I can disconnect it, mount a new front panel on the drive (seriously?), and USB it to my Mac. Once again, I have the pleasure of downloading software from the Seagate site so that Seagate Sync can transfer my media files to the 1TB drive for later streaming to my iOS devices. The idea is that after the initial transfer, your computer can switch to the Seagate wi-fi and sync the files as needed. This failed in my tests; my computer could not see the drive over wi-fi; when directly connected and visible in the side bar, it was not visible in Seagate Sync.After all of this tedium, I might be a happy customer, if my files were in reasonable order.

A single audiobook might run chapter 1 - chapter 10 - chapter 11 - random song - chapter 2 - second random song - etc. Needless to say, my iTunes library is in perfect order, and is intuitive enough to run chapter 1 nine chapters before chapter 10.For those willing to commit the time to solving the out-of-the-box problems (that may date from the 1/23/2013 firmware update), this drive provides impressive storage and streaming.

Another reviewer mentioned having used a similar sticker which caused me to seek it out.

After installing the sticker I was disappointed to see the skin itself isn't as rough as the packaging leads you to believe. Its slicker. Though it does off better resistance for you to hang on to the iPad I was hoping for more. I also do not like the price of this sticker.

A39ADPAPZO95IG,B002JPITXY,"JA ""Audioslave141""","[4, 4]","I've owned the Zune HD since day one (Sep 2009) and have used it daily since. When coupled with the Zune pass, it is an amazing digital music player. The features that add to or take away from the product are below:Pros:* Great sound quality. When I forget my Zune I am forced to listen to music using my iPhone 4 and I can definitely tell the difference between the two when using higher quality headphones.* The menus are easy to navigate, allowing me to get to the artist/album/song I want to listen to without too many steps.* It is small and thin, making it easy to stash in my bag, pocket, or to simply hold it when enjoying my music.* Being able to use the Zune Pass at the office (with wi-fi) lets me listen to an entire new album each Tuesday. This has helped me save money because I used to buy album after album on iTunes that I would give one or two listens to and then digitally shelve it. Now I can give it the one or two listens and then trash it or never download it locally. Due to this feature, I have also been able to listen to a wider range of music, helping me discover artists I would have never known of otherwise.Cons:* Limited apps. It is great that Microsoft gives away free apps to use, but they feel sub-par when comparing them to what's available in any respectable app store these days. Since they are free I can't complain too much, but none of them have held my attention like Angry Birds.* I am not thrilled with the screen size. It doesn't hurt that it's small if you only plan on using it for music, but it's just too small to browse the web or watch a video for more than a few minutes. I would like them to release one with at least a 4"" screen.* The screen is also nearly impossible to see in sunlight. It's an early OLED that has been leapfrogged by other screens in the marketplace.You should buy the Zune HD if you fall into the following categories:* You want a separate music player from your phone that has better sound quality than Apple-created products and has a nice software/cloud ecosystem (Cowon has better sound quality and supports more file formats, but the ecosystem doesn't really exist).* You enjoy music discovery and like the idea of paying $15/month for unlimited streaming/downloads, plus keep 10 songs a month. You can download the software and give it a test drive on your computer or XBOX 360 to see what the Zune Pass is all about.You should NOT buy it if you fall into these categories:* You already own a Windows Phone 7. (unless you must have a separate player, you already have all of the features of the Zune HD)* You have a lot of copyrighted music via iTunes (prior to the removal of the DRM) that you don't feel like paying to unlock. Keep in mind that you can still download everything that you had purchase through iTunes through the Zune marketplace for free, but you would only be able to keep them as long as you have a Zune Pass.* You must have a piece of hardware that is state-of-the-art and is guaranteed to be in production for years to come. This is almost 2 years old and is rumored to be killed by Microsoft in the coming months; therefore you may be locking yourself into the Zune ecosystem with few options (other than WP7, XBOX 360, and your computer) down the road.* You want to use it to play games, browse the internet, watch movies, and use productivity apps. It does not compare to an iPod Touch in these features.Overall I've enjoyed owning the Zune HD and would purchase another one if I lost or broke it.

Weighing in at just over 2.5 ounces, the Garmin Forerunner 305 breaks new ground in terms of comfort, style, and performance. Totally redesigned, the 305 gives outdoor athletes and runners real-time information about speed, distance, pace, and heart rate on a device that's easy to use and amazingly compact.The Forerunner 305 features the powerful new SiRF GPS navigation chip for supreme accuracy, even under tree cover and between tall buildings. A coded chest strap heart-rate monitor prevents unwanted interference from other devices.View larger.The unit's GPS receiver is designed to face towards the sky when you're running.A more watch-like design makes it far easier to use and wear.Plus, the 305 is engineered to help folks train better and smarter. Training assistant tools, various distance and time alerts, and bundled Training Center PC software combine to make the device an essential part of any athlete's training program.The 305's digitally coded heart-rate monitor--which is worn as a chest strap--sends heart-rate data to the device so you can see whether you're training too hard or not hard enough. Alerts for pace, distance, time, and heart rate are also available. Additionally, the unit tracks speed, distance, pace, and calories burned. Meanwhile, a course feature lets you race against previous runs in order to improve your time or just compare heart rate and pace data at every point of the way.The 305's easy-to-read, 1.3-inch display has been integrated into a sleek and stylish form factor that is definitely a step up from the larger and more cumbersome Forerunner 301 model. Indeed, the 305 looks and wears like a stylish sports watch, and it's more carefully designed to meet the needs of athletes. The design also positions the antenna with an optimal view of the sky. As an added feature, the case is water resistant to IEC 60529 IPX7 standards (can be submerged in one meter of water for 30 minutes).Accuracy is the name of the game with the 305. The vastly more accurate GPS antenna and receiver, which uses an advanced SiRF chip, offer much faster satellite acquisition times. Plus, the unit can hold a fix in places never before possible. Gone are the days of losing a fix under tree cover or when running between tall buildings. All of these features add up to far more accuracy in recording and tracking your exercise data. And because the 305 uses GPS to track how far and how fast you're going, you never have to calibrate it. The unit also doubles as a basic navigator. Mark your starting point as a specific location, see your current position on the plotter display, and follow an electronic breadcrumb trail back to your starting point.The 305 features a USB data connection and docking cradle for downloading your speed, lap, exercise time, and heart-rate data into Garmin's Training Center PC software. The unit stores up to 1,000 lap histories, which you can download to your PC for a detailed post-workout analysis. Plus, you can create and schedule workouts using the included software and download them to the unit. A rechargeable internal lithium-ion battery offers up to ten hours of battery life.For additional post-workout analysis, the 305 is compatible with MotionBased software. MotionBased adds a new dimension to training and outdoor fitness that makes the analytical aspects of a sport more compelling and a lot more fun. You can upload data to MotionBased, a Web-based application that has partnered with Garmin. MotionBased provides in-depth analysis of your workouts, as well as online mapping and route sharing that will take your training to the next level. MotionBased automatically calculates time, distance, speed, elevation, and heart rate, and it displays this information through meaningful charts, illustrations, reports, and maps. With MotionBased, you can also race multiple instances of the same route to see how you are improving or to race other members of MotionBased.

A2RUUTTFJQ7CBH,B00AXSNBCI,Anton Tobias,"[3, 4]","For anyone considering the Glide Gear DNA 1000, there are a few things you should consider before purchasing this stabilizing unit.  First, the DNA 1000 is very time consuming to set up and almost impossible to keep balanced because of, what seems to be, a poorly calibrated gimbal that can not be adjusted.  Potential buyers should also be aware that the unit comes with a set-up and operations manual that includes a twenty seven page, fifty step process to construct and adjust the stabilizer.  This is especially important to consider because even when instructions are followed exactly as described, the faulty gimbal renders all the hard work useless, which I'll discuss later.  This construction and balancing process can take anywhere from an hour or more depending how well the individual building and attempting to balance it follows and understands instructions.  It also depends on how tolerant they are of the frustrating hang-ups in construction of the DNA 1000.Once assembled the Glide Gear DNA feels sort of shoddy.  True, the unit uses anodized and powder coated aircraft grade aluminum, however the three main pieces (the tripod mount, central post with gimbal and base platform) are each held together with a single and common household hex screw.  This poor design creates a ""loose"" feel to the DNA 1000 which makes the entire unit wobbly, often times twisting out of place, throwing off the balance the operator has just spent an hour meticulously adjusting.  This is especially evident where the base platform meets the central post, frequently loosening itself enough for me to think, perhaps the unit was damaged in shipping.  Further, the adjustment knob/clamp, used for length adjustment, toward the bottom of the central post is made of plastic.  The obvious problem being that with small plastic clamps breakage is a real potential, especially when constantly being adjusted with metal hex screws.  I personally don't understand how a camera stabilizer of this price can be so misrepresented in its product description.When using the stabilizer, the fragile balance of the DNA 1000 is constantly threatened by the loose build and non-adjustable, miscalibrated gimbal, mentioned earlier.  Allow me to explain as best I can; according to steps 37 to 44 in the operation manual there is a long process to balancing the DNA 1000 by carefully adjusting the camera mount back and forth, side to side.  Again, this is a tremendous pain because after precisely balancing the camera mount (down to the millimeter) it is necessary to lock it in place.  This is done by hand tightening eight separate screws which is impossible to do without slightly moving the camera mount.  This is simply the result of basic physics; with the screws being tightened at separate times the balance is again thrown off, leaving the owner to start the tedious process all over.Which brings us to the faulty gimbal.  In a perfect world the Glide Gear DNA 1000 would be balanced with minimal effort (as described in the product description), but this is reality and the DNA 1000, like almost anything else, has its share of problems.  Once (if) the user manages to painstakingly construct and balance the stabilizer it won't matter because of the gimbal, it always creeps to the right or left...no matter what.  This creates a lopsided floating effect that can only be remedied with a cockeyed grip; twisting one's wrist to accommodate for the faulty swing.  How's that for frustrating?  I personally don't mind taking the time to calibrate a stabilizer in order to achieve a shot, but when all my hard work is pointless from the beginning, it just makes the whole product less than useless because it's only wasting my time.With all these faults to consider, it should be noted even without all the problematic limitations described above the DNA 1000 takes a decent chunk of time to assemble and balance.  So if you're a film maker wanting a glide shot, be advised...plan ahead.  You'll be spending more time building and balancing than filming.I've managed to half-remedy the faulty gimbal/camera creep syndrome by adding more weights than necessary to the bottom plate and shooting with a dedicated camcorder with an internal, optical stabilizer (instead of a DSLR).  The extra weight seems to pull the stabilizer down enough to minimize the gimbal swing.  The balance of the DNA 1000 is off, but sort of corrected by the camcorder itself stabilizing the shot.  I guess this works okay, but it's certainly not what I paid for.After a full day of tireless adjusting, readjusting and experimenting with Glide Gear DNA 1000 it's my opinion it could use a redesign.  There is far too much work involved for this product to be of any practical use, especially when shooting on a time schedule.  In all honesty, it felt as if I was fighting with the stabilizer more than using it.  Once I did get the unit to cooperate (with roughly six hours of tedious adjusting) I was too terrified to disassemble it.

First, the DNA 1000 is very time consuming to set up and almost impossible to keep balanced because of, what seems to be, a poorly calibrated gimbal that can not be adjusted. Potential buyers should also be aware that the unit comes with a set-up and operations manual that includes a twenty seven page, fifty step process to construct and adjust the stabilizer.

A44UKZE6XEV9,B0055QYJM4,Eddie E. Hicks,"[2, 2]","I bought this HDTV to replace an older 26"" Sylvania HDTV for my basement game/workout room. The TV is used to play PS3 games and to view TV while working out on treadmill and stationary bike. I have Comcast Cable connected directly to the TV without a cable box, so I don't get HD TV on it. The channels in standard defintion at 480i are just horrible. Some of the channels in 720p are slightly better. The channels in 1080i are decent. I was thinking that it just wasn't exceptable even at the under 200.00 I paid until I played a Blu-Ray movie on my PS3. Wow, what a differnce in HD. The Haier is excellent in HD. Also games played with my PS3 look great. I own a 58"" Samsung plasma and a 32"" Phillips LCD so I know HD is much better than SD. But on my other 3 HDTV's including the much older 26"" Sylvania, the SD channels are much better than on the Haier. The audio has a lot to be desired. I have a 5.1 surround sound system made for the XBOX 360 connected to the Haier that addresses the poor audio situation. One other strange issue is how the TV channels are numbered when you do the auto channel search. Some of the channels are numbered like, 17.1, 17.2 17.3. I never saw that before. One positive is that the Haier found a lot more digital channels without a cable box than the Sylvania could.******UPDATE November 28, 2013*****After just over 2 years of owning this TV it just completely died. The only thing that works is the blue/red on and off indicator light. I see many more people here had the exact same thing happen.

A3R1WFO4KIUQXZ,B00BQ5RY1G,PhotoGraphics,"[1, 2]","There are certain things that are more challenging than others to make a decision on based solely on reviews and specs.  The Harmony Ultimate falls into that category.  Since it does so much, in so many ways, the way I use it versus the way you use it versus the way your neighbor uses it can be, and probably are, worlds apart.  Logitech's product description certainly lets you know that it is designed to operate several devices (in other words, replace several remote controls) and also that it can be programmed to set up sequences of events, like turn TV on, set to proper input, turn amplifier on and set to proper input and turn off unused devices.  The combinations are endless and no matter what, some won't always work as expected.  I've owned previous similar remotes from Logitech and other companies and I'll attest to the Ultimate being the most user-friendly and versatile of them all.Things I like:1. The remote is rechargeable, sits upright in the provided cradle and the keys light up automatically, turn off automatically and reactivate when the control senses motion.  Not so rosy is that the battery is not user replaceable ... if it dies you are advised to throw it away.2. The button arrangement and ""feel"" of the control are near perfect so that after a short while you rarely have to look at the keys.  Some people don't care for the transport buttons (ie. FF/REW/PLAY/PAUSE) being at the top.  After getting used to them being there you will find that the shape of the case causes your hand to naturally hold it in the right position to reach all keys comfortably.  Personally, once I trained myself to use my index finger for those keys instead of my thumb I love the design.3. TiVo users will quickly find that the keys they use the vast majority of the time are just as instinctive as TiVo's own kidney-shaped control ... only better.  Every TiVo function is easier and more natural on the Harmony Ultimate than on the TiVo remote.Areas for improvement:1. Logitech needs a LOT of work on communicating the basics of setting up their remotes.  Even though I've set up similar remotes, until I got to the actual programming of the device I was baffled as to what I was expected to do.2. Someone at Logitech needs to realize that the days of someone in the household ""owning"" the remote control are ancient history.  They need to have the means to add additional controllers to the hub (either Ultimate-style or basic-style).  I believe the majority of two adult households require at least 2 remotes controlling the same devices, however after detailed discussion with a very helpful tech support I was assured that the hub is keyed to the Ultimate remote and no other can be added or used.  Why is this important?  Most people aren't techies.  While the Ultimate remote is easy to use after you get used to it, you may have a non-techie spouse or elders in the household who would simply like to adjust the volume or change channels.  If the ""owner"" has the remote, what do they do?  If they try to use the original remote that came with the device it messes up the sequencing of the Harmony.3. Clarifying that statement, yes it IS possible to load an app to most smartphones and use it with the Ultimate hub, however this ends up being a ""look how cool this is"" gadget to show off to your friends the first time and then never use again.  By the time you startup the app, which takes 5-10 seconds you see how useless it is, plus the obvious fact that using your phone as a TV remote gets in the way of using it as a phone and texting.4. The AC transformers are about twice the size of similar units from Logitech or other manufacturers.  I could not fit two of them side-by-side in my installation and had to add an AC power cube to fit them.Observations:1. I noticed a couple of unusual things when I opened the box.  While the components were securely packed, unlike the vast majority of current electronic accessories, especially high-end ones, the 3 major pieces were simply sitting in molded plastic wells (the kind of plastic Hostess cupcakes are packed in).  There was no clear film or other protection around the components.  I don't consider that a negative and it doesn't take anything away from the item's performance, but like I said, it seemed unusual.  The other thing that caught my attention is that the remote had zero charge to the battery, not even the slightest amount to power on.  I can't recall anything I've bought in recent memory that didn't come with at least a bit of a charge to it.2. I'm tempted to repeat ""for its $350 price"" numerous times throughout this review because, let's face it; $350 is a ton of money for a remote control.  I'll try not to do that and just make the blanket statement that from all outward appearances it just doesn't seem like you're getting something that should cost $350.3. In addition to the remote, charging base and transponder unit referred to above, the box contains 2 AC power transformers, two IR devices and one standard USB cable to connect the remote to your computer.  Plus there is a small map-like foldout setup guide.  No CD's.  I strongly suggest before you touch anything that you create a Harmony account and read the online setup guides or you will be completely lost, including the most basic things like how long you should charge the battery before attempting to use the remote.Summary:The look and feel of this remote is stunning.  The touchscreen is responsive and sharp, the buttons activate positively, the rough surface on the back of the remote prevents accidental slippage, the haptic feedback of the screen assures accuracy, and the two included IR sensors will accommodate virtually every installation.  Once you get used to it you will find it very hard to go back to almost any other remote control.  It would have earned 5-stars on almost every point except that you can't add a second or third remote for other members of the household.  That's a serious flaw and drops the rating a full star.",4.0,Harmony Ultimate comprehensive review,1375920000,"08 8, 2013","There are certain things that are more challenging than others to make a decision on based solely on reviews and specs.

There was no clear film or other protection around the components. I don't consider that a negative and it doesn't take anything away from the item's performance, but like I said, it seemed unusual. The other thing that caught my attention is that the remote had zero charge to the battery, not even the slightest amount to power on. I can't recall anything I've bought in recent memory that didn't come with at least a bit of a charge to it.2. I'm tempted to repeat ""for its $350 price"" numerous times throughout this review because, let's face it; $350 is a ton of money for a remote control. I'll try not to do that and just make the blanket statement that from all outward appearances it just doesn't seem like you're getting something that should cost $350.3. In addition to the remote, charging base and transponder unit referred to above, the box contains 2 AC power transformers, two IR devices and one standard USB cable to connect the remote to your computer. Plus there is a small map-like foldout setup guide. No CD's. I strongly suggest before you touch anything that you create a Harmony account and read the online setup guides or you will be completely lost, including the most basic things like how long you should charge the battery before attempting to use the remote.Summary:The look and feel of this remote is stunning. The touchscreen is responsive and sharp, the buttons activate positively, the rough surface on the back of the remote prevents accidental slippage, the haptic feedback of the screen assures accuracy, and the two included IR sensors will accommodate virtually every installation. Once you get used to it you will find it very hard to go back to almost any other remote control. It would have earned 5-stars on almost every point except that you can't add a second or third remote for other members of the household. That's a serious flaw and drops the rating a full star.",Harmony Ultimate comprehensive review,2013-08-08,Logitech Harmony Ultimate Remote with Customizable Touch Screen and Closed Cabinet RF Control - Black (915-000201),,343.99,Logitech,Accessories & Supplies,Audio & Video Accessories,Amazon,2013,8,3,4964,0.9344879518072289,1,2,0.5,5985,0.19797491810330564,3.323481188577479,2.6666666666666665,1.5275252316519468,3,3,4.333333333333333,0.8997354108424374,15,15,Logitech Harmony Ultimate Remote with Customizable Touch Screen and Closed Cabinet RF Control - Black (915-000201) ,1395,4802

I wanted a mount that would be able to be positioned at a verticle tilt, but didn't need to be moved after the initial install, so an expensive Omnimount or Peerless mount wasn't needed.Opening the box, I discovered that the attached plastice bubble level was crushed and useless... No biggie, since it wasn't a selling point for me. I used mu own bullet level to install.  The unit comes fully assembled except for the VESA brackets for the TV.  Since th unit is like 28 lbs, I used the provided allen wrench to uncrew the mounting place from the arms... not sure why it ships assembled when it's easier to install  the plate without the arms attached (as well as using a level on the top.I noticed how cheap the lagbolts were and used my own, tossing the cheap ones.  There's no reason to twist a head off to prove they are bad as they look and feel.  After mounting the plate and reattaching the arms the unit is installed.  Befor attaching the adjustable brackets to the plasma, I tested their attachment to the arm plate.  Thankfully I did this before trying to setup the TV on them.  The M6 security screw is too short to effectively lock the TV arms in place... So I used a 1"" longer M6 screw (metric) and then it worked fine.For one of the cheapest mounts of this type out there.. its worth the terrible hardware issues, but it only gets 3 stars because I didnt trust the cheap lags and had to go buy 2 M6 screws that would actually lock in the tv to the mounting plate.  Once the TV was installed, it positioned the TV perfectly and I used the uncluded Allen wrenches to tighten up the arms.You get what you pay for, but the pain was expected at this price and bottom line, the product works with a two dollars of replacement parts.Edited to add a few notes:  This is a mount that requires 16"" OC stud position.  it's mounting plate will not support 24""OC studs.",3.0,"Cheap, and works, but I had to replace screws with higher quality",1346371200,"08 31, 2012","I was looking for a cheap articulating mount for a Samsung PN60E6500 plasma tv...

The EOS Rebel XSi brings staggering technological innovation to the masses. It features Canon’s EOS Integrated Cleaning System, Live View Function, a powerful DIGIC III Image Processor, plus a new 12.2-megapixel CMOS sensor and is available in a kit with the new EF-S 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 IS lens with Optical Image Stabilizer. The EOS Rebel XSi’s refined, ergonomic design includes a new 3.0-inch LCD monitor, compatibility with SD and SDHC memory cards and new accessories that enhance every aspect of the photographic experience.Canon EOS Rebel XSi HighlightsNew Technology for Outstanding Images12.2-megapixel APS-C Size CMOS sensorNew Canon 12.2-megapixel CMOS sensor and DIGIC III image processorCanon's CMOS (complementary metal oxide semiconductor) sensor captures images with exceptional clarity and tonal range, and offers the most pixels in its class. It offers many of the same new technologies to maximize each pixel's light gathering efficiency that were first seen with the professional EOS-1D Mark III model. It's an APS-C size sensor (22.2 x 14.8mm), and there's an effective 1.6x increase in the lens’s marked focal length when attached. Canon’s DIGIC III Image Processor dramatically enhances image quality and speeds up all camera operations for intuitive operation. It works in concert with the EOS Rebel XSi’s sensor to achieve unprecedented levels of performance in all lighting situations.14-bit A/D converterWith the EOS Rebel XSi, analog to digital signal conversion is executed by a 14-bit processor, which generates digital data with incredibly smooth tones. Formerly a feature only present in top-of-the-line pro digital SLR cameras, the 14-bit conversion gives incredibly smooth transitions from light to dark colors, with far less risk of ""banding."" A sky at sunset is a perfect example. With this rich 14-bit gradation the EOS Rebel XSi offers RAW images of the highest quality that can be processed with Canon’s Digital Photo Professional software. Even JPEG files, which are always finished at 8-bits per channel, use the full 14-bit conversion initially to generate the best possible color and tonal detail. Another huge benefit of the 14-bit conversion is the Highlight Tone Priority option, which allows critical shooters to increase the level of detail in bright areas of a scene up to one stop, without affecting overall exposure.Auto OptimizationThe EOS Rebel XSi’s Auto Optimization is yet another image-quality tool that comes to the rescue in tricky lighting conditions. It can actually lighten dark areas of a scene while ensuring that bright areas maintain tonal detail. It's now available in all shooting modes, including P, Tv, Av, and Manual.DIGIC III image processorDeveloped to maximize performance between the capture and recording stages of digital photography, the EOS Rebel XSi’s latest-generation DIGIC III Image Processor works in concert with Canon’s CMOS sensor to achieve even higher levels of performance. The entire electronic system is totally redesigned, giving the camera its incredible combination of speed and image quality. Digital noise is significantly reduced in shadow areas, and color reproduction is superior.Speedy, Precise OperationExcellent performance with 3.5 fps continuous shooting, up to 53 full-resolution JPEGs or 6 RAW images in a burstThe EOS Rebel XSi operates with such effortless speed that operation is nothing short of intuitive. With instant startup times, speedy autofocus and minimal shutter lag, the EOS Rebel XSi is one of the fastest cameras available today. It can shoot up to 3.5 frames per second, in bursts of 53 JPEGs or 6 RAW files, so you’ll never, ever, miss a shot.See the image in large LCD with Live View FunctionThe EOS Rebel XSi has a huge, bright 3.0-inch TFT LCD monitor with 230,000 pixels and a viewing angle of 170 degrees. It’s perfect for Live View composition or viewing camera settings like AF, ISO, Metering, AF Point selection and flash options. And the maximum brightness of the EOS Rebel XSi LCD monitor is about 30-percent greater than its predecessor, which is a big benefit when you're using the camera in bright sunlight.Live View FunctionLive View Function enables you to view your subjects directly on the huge 3.0-inch LCD monitor. It's easy to magnify any part of the scene 5x or 10x for precise manual focus. And now, there are two ways to use Autofocus along with Live View Function in the EOS Rebel XSi. You can even choose a grid overlay, perfect for keeping straight lines in your subject straight in your pictures. In the studio, Live View Function can be used remotely via a computer through the EOS Rebel XSi’s USB connection.Fast 9-point AF system, and two types of AF during Live View FunctionThe EOS Rebel XSi has a high-precision 9-point wide area AF sensor for fast, accurate focus even in dim lighting. It has a number of focus modes, including One-Shot AF, AI Focus AF, AI Servo AF and Manual. In Live View Function, the EOS Rebel XSi has two AF modes: Quick mode, which uses the camera's standard 9-point AF system, and Live mode, which is a contrast-based AF system that reads the sharpness of subjects right from the imaging sensor, and can be overridden by pressing the AF mode selection button. A familiar feature in PowerShot cameras, Live mode AF uses similar technologies to achieve focus, while Quick mode is more appropriate for capturing action or for shooting in low light.Compatible with compact SD and SDHC memory cardsThe EOS Rebel XSi is the first EOS Digital SLR camera to use popular SD and SDHC memory cards only. Compact, inexpensive and available in increasingly large capacities, SD and SDHC memory cards are a perfect complement to the EOS Rebel XSi’s compact and lightweight body design.Advanced Features for Advanced PhotographyNew advanced features include spot metering, external flash settings on the camera’s menu, and a new higher-magnification viewfinderThe EOS Rebel XSi’s 35-zone evaluative metering system with improved white balance analyzes light based on each zone in the viewing area, enabling the camera to choose the overall best exposure for the entire scene. It now features a spot meter, which reads a tiny area (about 4 percent) of the picture for extremely precise metering. It also provides Center-weighted average metering and partial metering for accurate exposure no matter the situation. The EOS Rebel XSi also has an improved, high magnification viewfinder that provides a larger overall view, and increased brightness and clarity. And the EOS Rebel XSi has a Display-Off sensor that automatically turns the LCD monitor off whenever the camera is at the photographer's eye. All relevant shooting information, including ISO, is displayed right in the viewfinder so it’s easy to change settings without moving the camera away from the eye.EOS Integrated Cleaning SystemPhotographers who must change lenses in dusty environments will find the advanced Canon EOS Integrated Cleaning System a tremendous time saver. Dust that settles on the sensor surface is removed using ultrasonic vibration. This Self Cleaning Sensor Unit routine is automatically activated whenever the camera is powered on or off. (It can also be manually activated.) A special collar positioned around the sensor collects the loosened dust. Dust particles can also be automatically removed via software. By shooting a plain white subject, the photographer can acquire dust position data that is transmitted along with the image (whether JPEG or RAW). Canon Digital Photo Professional (DPP) version 3.3 or later software can be used to manually or automatically erase the dust spots. It's not one feature, it's a built-in system to minimize the effect of dust in high-resolution digital images.Self Cleaning Sensor UnitA key element of minimizing dust is preventing it from clinging to the front surface of the imaging sensor. To combat against this, the EOS Rebel XSi features a Canon-designed Self Cleaning Sensor Unit. The low-pass filter at the front of the sensor shakes off dust automatically with ultrasonic vibrations, removing dust from the sensor assembly. The EOS Rebel XSi has a new coating on the front surface of the low-pass filter, to increase its resistance to dust sticking to the sensor.Dust Delete Data DetectionDust that may still remain on the front of the sensor can also be erased with software included in Digital Photo Professional (DPP) Version 3.3 or later software. A simple test shot of a plain, white object can be taken, using a menu setting. This Dust Delete Data image is analyzed in-camera, and the location and size of any remaining dust is added to any subsequent pictures taken. This data is transmitted along with the image, whether JPEG or RAW, and can be either manually or automatically erased in Canon’s DPP version 3.3 and later software. This added software option ensures the cleanest possible image, perfect for printing or archiving.Picture Style settingsWith the EOS Rebel XSi’s Picture Style technology, photographers can change the look of their digital photographs. Color, saturation, sharpness and contrast settings create noticeable variation in the saved image. Changing a Picture Style setting is almost like a 35mm film user switching from one type of color film to another. In addition to six preset Picture Style settings, Canon offers additional downloadable ""Picture Style Files,"" that can be installed into your camera for even more imaging options at your fingertips.Highlight Tone PriorityThis vital Custom Function lets photographers get even better detail in bright highlights, even in contrasty lighting conditions. It’s beneficial for nearly any type of picture, from mid-day shots on a safari to portraits in sunlight, where a user may encounter bright highlight areas where he or she wants to preserve details. Finally, there’s no impact on the camera’s shooting speed or burst rate when Highlight Tone Priority is engaged. It takes full advantage of the EOS Rebel XSi's new 14-bit per channel conversion, meaning there are 16,384 distinct colors from darkest to lightest in each color channel.Shooting and Sharing Made EasyIncludes EF-S 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 Image Stabilizer lensThe Canon EF-S 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 IS zoom lens features the wide-angle to mid-range zoom flexibility of its non-IS predecessor with the significant advantage of Canon's true optical, lens-shift image stabilization system that yields up to a full four stops of image-shake correction.Fully compatible with over 60 EF/EF-S Lenses and a wide range of EOS System accessoriesEOS Rebel XSi is compatible with all Canon lenses in the EF and EF-S lineup, ranging from ultra-wide angle to super telephoto lenses. Canon lenses employ advanced optical expertise and micron-precision engineering to deliver unprecedented performance in all facets of the photographic process. Special optical technologies, such as Aspherical, ultra-low dispersion, or fluorite elements are featured in the universally acclaimed L Series lenses, and Canon's Optical Image Stabilizer technology are featured in select lenses to minimize the effect of camera shake. Through Canon lenses, photographers can truly maximize the quality and liberating performance of the EOS Rebel XSi.Flash PhotographyThe EOS Rebel XSi features the acclaimed E-TTL II flash metering system. With any of the flashes in the EX Speedlite line, E-TTL II provides reliable flash output whether shooting fill-in flash pictures in sunlight, or using flash in total darkness. With E-TTL II, the exact same 35-zone metering sensor used for measuring ambient light is also used for flash metering -- giving even finer metering command of the image area. If you prefer a broader area for flash metering, there's a menu setting to change to ""Average"" flash metering, where the entire 35-zone area is measured evenly for flash exposure.The Canon Speedlite 430EX is the ideal step-up accessory for powerful flash shooting with the EOS Rebel XSi. It has excellent flash power (maximum guide number of 141 ft./43m at ISO 100), and is the perfect way to get great flash pictures when you can't get right up to the subject. The 430EX is also great for bounce flash, with its tilting and swiveling flash head. It automatically zooms the flash head to cover lenses ranging from 16mm up to 105mm or longer with the EOS Rebel XSi. Of course, it works with the camera to provide full E-TTL II automatic flash exposure. And the 430EX has a powerful AF-assist beam, which allows the camera to autofocus even in total darkness on subjects as far as 32 ft. from the camera.Included SoftwareCanon EOS Digital Solution Disk (Version 17.0)The EOS Rebel XSi comes bundled with an updated Canon EOS Digital Solution Disk, which features powerful software programs designed to extend the EOS experience to the computer. These include Canon's ZoomBrowser EX for Windows (Version 6.1), ImageBrowser for Macintosh OS X (Version 6.1), Digital Photo Professional (Version 3.3), the totally new Picture Style Editor (Version 1.0), Canon’s EOS Utility (Version 2.2), RAW Image Task (Version 2.8), PhotoStitch, and PTP TWAIN Driver. Each application is designed to perfect the captured images and streamline the digital workflow. ZoomBrowser EX v.6.1 and Digital Photo Professional v.3.3 for Windows are compatible with the new Windows Vista operating system.Digital Photo Professional (Version 3.3)is an image processing program that enables high-speed RAW image processing, high-speed previewing for real-time image adjustment and support for sRGB, Adobe RGB and Wide Gamut RGB color spaces. Because it’s CMS (Color Management System) compatible, Digital Photo Professional allows for easy image layout and printing in Adobe RGB in conjunction with Easy-PhotoPrint and PictBridge printers. It also features the Dust Delete Data Detection tool for cleaner images.EOS Utility (Version 2.3) for Macintosh or Windowshandles the connection between the camera and computer, whenever they’re connected via USB. It allows remote controlled shooting from the computer, handles downloading of images from the camera to the computer, and allows seamless linking to either Canon’s ZoomBrowser/ImageBrowser or Digital Photo Professional software once images have been copied to the hard drive. Furthermore, it’s used to upload settings back into a USB-connected camera.ZoomBrowser EX (Version 6.1) for Windows and ImageBrowser (Version 6.1) for Mac OS Xare the easy, user-friendly options for viewing and editing of JPEG and even RAW image files. Both allow viewing of numerous types of images including finished TIFF and BMP files. Both also have a variety of search options for finding images, allow re-naming of single images or batches of files, and offer a variety of options for printing without using a separate image-editing program.RAW Image Task (Version 2.8) for Windows/MacintoshThis software is an integrated component of ZoomBrowser EX (Windows) or ImageBrowser (Mac). It allows processing of RAW images from EOS cameras, including the new EOS Rebel XSi, with a variety of adjustment possibilities. These options, as well as the overall color, contrast and ""look"" of RAW Image Task, closely mimic the characteristics of Canon’s in-camera JPEG processing.What's in the BoxCanon Rebel XSi camera, EF-S 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 Image Stabilizer lens, rechargeable battery pack and charger, USB and video cables, a neckstrap, an EOS Solutions Disk CD, and a 1-year Canon U.S.A., Inc. limited warranty",17.12,Unknown,Camera & Photo,Digital Cameras,Amazon,2008,7,2,3115,0.5864081325301205,1,2,0.5,485,0.015982263988617188,3.8869866979914627,4.5,0.7071067811865476,2,2,4.619047619047619,0.9206622874969126,21,21,"Canon Digital Rebel XSI 12.2 MP Digital SLR Camera with EF-S 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 IS Lens (Silver) For stunning photography with point and shoot ease, look no further than Canon’s EOS Rebel XSi. The EOS Rebel XSi brings staggering technological innovation to the masses. It features Canon’s EOS Integrated Cleaning System, Live View Function, a powerful DIGIC III Image Processor, plus a new 12.2-megapixel CMOS sensor and is available in a kit with the new EF-S 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 IS lens with Optical Image Stabilizer. The EOS Rebel XSi’s refined, ergonomic design includes a new 3.0-inch LCD monitor, compatibility with SD and SDHC memory cards and new accessories that enhance every aspect of the photographic experience.Canon EOS Rebel XSi HighlightsNew Technology for Outstanding Images12.2-megapixel APS-C Size CMOS sensorNew Canon 12.2-megapixel CMOS sensor and DIGIC III image processorCanon's CMOS (complementary metal oxide semiconductor) sensor captures images with exceptional clarity and tonal range, and offers the most pixels in its class. It offers many of the same new technologies to maximize each pixel's light gathering efficiency that were first seen with the professional EOS-1D Mark III model. It's an APS-C size sensor (22.2 x 14.8mm), and there's an effective 1.6x increase in the lens’s marked focal length when attached. Canon’s DIGIC III Image Processor dramatically enhances image quality and speeds up all camera operations for intuitive operation. It works in concert with the EOS Rebel XSi’s sensor to achieve unprecedented levels of performance in all lighting situations.14-bit A/D converterWith the EOS Rebel XSi, analog to digital signal conversion is executed by a 14-bit processor, which generates digital data with incredibly smooth tones. Formerly a feature only present in top-of-the-line pro digital SLR cameras, the 14-bit conversion gives incredibly smooth transitions from light to dark colors, with far less risk of ""banding."" A sky at sunset is a perfect example. With this rich 14-bit gradation the EOS Rebel XSi offers RAW images of the highest quality that can be processed with Canon’s Digital Photo Professional software. Even JPEG files, which are always finished at 8-bits per channel, use the full 14-bit conversion initially to generate the best possible color and tonal detail. Another huge benefit of the 14-bit conversion is the Highlight Tone Priority option, which allows critical shooters to increase the level of detail in bright areas of a scene up to one stop, without affecting overall exposure.Auto OptimizationThe EOS Rebel XSi’s Auto Optimization is yet another image-quality tool that comes to the rescue in tricky lighting conditions. It can actually lighten dark areas of a scene while ensuring that bright areas maintain tonal detail. It's now available in all shooting modes, including P, Tv, Av, and Manual.DIGIC III image processorDeveloped to maximize performance between the capture and recording stages of digital photography, the EOS Rebel XSi’s latest-generation DIGIC III Image Processor works in concert with Canon’s CMOS sensor to achieve even higher levels of performance. The entire electronic system is totally redesigned, giving the camera its incredible combination of speed and image quality. Digital noise is significantly reduced in shadow areas, and color reproduction is superior.Speedy, Precise OperationExcellent performance with 3.5 fps continuous shooting, up to 53 full-resolution JPEGs or 6 RAW images in a burstThe EOS Rebel XSi operates with such effortless speed that operation is nothing short of intuitive. With instant startup times, speedy autofocus and minimal shutter lag, the EOS Rebel XSi is one of the fastest cameras available today. It can shoot up to 3.5 frames per second, in bursts of 53 JPEGs or 6 RAW files, so you’ll never, ever, miss a shot.See the image in large LCD with Live View FunctionThe EOS Rebel XSi has a huge, bright 3.0-inch TFT LCD monitor with 230,000 pixels and a viewing angle of 170 degrees. It’s perfect for Live View composition or viewing camera settings like AF, ISO, Metering, AF Point selection and flash options. And the maximum brightness of the EOS Rebel XSi LCD monitor is about 30-percent greater than its predecessor, which is a big benefit when you're using the camera in bright sunlight.Live View FunctionLive View Function enables you to view your subjects directly on the huge 3.0-inch LCD monitor. It's easy to magnify any part of the scene 5x or 10x for precise manual focus. And now, there are two ways to use Autofocus along with Live View Function in the EOS Rebel XSi. You can even choose a grid overlay, perfect for keeping straight lines in your subject straight in your pictures. In the studio, Live View Function can be used remotely via a computer through the EOS Rebel XSi’s USB connection.Fast 9-point AF system, and two types of AF during Live View FunctionThe EOS Rebel XSi has a high-precision 9-point wide area AF sensor for fast, accurate focus even in dim lighting. It has a number of focus modes, including One-Shot AF, AI Focus AF, AI Servo AF and Manual. In Live View Function, the EOS Rebel XSi has two AF modes: Quick mode, which uses the camera's standard 9-point AF system, and Live mode, which is a contrast-based AF system that reads the sharpness of subjects right from the imaging sensor, and can be overridden by pressing the AF mode selection button. A familiar feature in PowerShot cameras, Live mode AF uses similar technologies to achieve focus, while Quick mode is more appropriate for capturing action or for shooting in low light.Compatible with compact SD and SDHC memory cardsThe EOS Rebel XSi is the first EOS Digital SLR camera to use popular SD and SDHC memory cards only. Compact, inexpensive and available in increasingly large capacities, SD and SDHC memory cards are a perfect complement to the EOS Rebel XSi’s compact and lightweight body design.Advanced Features for Advanced PhotographyNew advanced features include spot metering, external flash settings on the camera’s menu, and a new higher-magnification viewfinderThe EOS Rebel XSi’s 35-zone evaluative metering system with improved white balance analyzes light based on each zone in the viewing area, enabling the camera to choose the overall best exposure for the entire scene. It now features a spot meter, which reads a tiny area (about 4 percent) of the picture for extremely precise metering. It also provides Center-weighted average metering and partial metering for accurate exposure no matter the situation. The EOS Rebel XSi also has an improved, high magnification viewfinder that provides a larger overall view, and increased brightness and clarity. And the EOS Rebel XSi has a Display-Off sensor that automatically turns the LCD monitor off whenever the camera is at the photographer's eye. All relevant shooting information, including ISO, is displayed right in the viewfinder so it’s easy to change settings without moving the camera away from the eye.EOS Integrated Cleaning SystemPhotographers who must change lenses in dusty environments will find the advanced Canon EOS Integrated Cleaning System a tremendous time saver. Dust that settles on the sensor surface is removed using ultrasonic vibration. This Self Cleaning Sensor Unit routine is automatically activated whenever the camera is powered on or off. (It can also be manually activated.) A special collar positioned around the sensor collects the loosened dust. Dust particles can also be automatically removed via software. By shooting a plain white subject, the photographer can acquire dust position data that is transmitted along with the image (whether JPEG or RAW). Canon Digital Photo Professional (DPP) version 3.3 or later software can be used to manually or automatically erase the dust spots. It's not one feature, it's a built-in system to minimize the effect of dust in high-resolution digital images.Self Cleaning Sensor UnitA key element of minimizing dust is preventing it from clinging to the front surface of the imaging sensor. To combat against this, the EOS Rebel XSi features a Canon-designed Self Cleaning Sensor Unit. The low-pass filter at the front of the sensor shakes off dust automatically with ultrasonic vibrations, removing dust from the sensor assembly. The EOS Rebel XSi has a new coating on the front surface of the low-pass filter, to increase its resistance to dust sticking to the sensor.Dust Delete Data DetectionDust that may still remain on the front of the sensor can also be erased with software included in Digital Photo Professional (DPP) Version 3.3 or later software. A simple test shot of a plain, white object can be taken, using a menu setting. This Dust Delete Data image is analyzed in-camera, and the location and size of any remaining dust is added to any subsequent pictures taken. This data is transmitted along with the image, whether JPEG or RAW, and can be either manually or automatically erased in Canon’s DPP version 3.3 and later software. This added software option ensures the cleanest possible image, perfect for printing or archiving.Picture Style settingsWith the EOS Rebel XSi’s Picture Style technology, photographers can change the look of their digital photographs. Color, saturation, sharpness and contrast settings create noticeable variation in the saved image. Changing a Picture Style setting is almost like a 35mm film user switching from one type of color film to another. In addition to six preset Picture Style settings, Canon offers additional downloadable ""Picture Style Files,"" that can be installed into your camera for even more imaging options at your fingertips.Highlight Tone PriorityThis vital Custom Function lets photographers get even better detail in bright highlights, even in contrasty lighting conditions. It’s beneficial for nearly any type of picture, from mid-day shots on a safari to portraits in sunlight, where a user may encounter bright highlight areas where he or she wants to preserve details. Finally, there’s no impact on the camera’s shooting speed or burst rate when Highlight Tone Priority is engaged. It takes full advantage of the EOS Rebel XSi's new 14-bit per channel conversion, meaning there are 16,384 distinct colors from darkest to lightest in each color channel.Shooting and Sharing Made EasyIncludes EF-S 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 Image Stabilizer lensThe Canon EF-S 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 IS zoom lens features the wide-angle to mid-range zoom flexibility of its non-IS predecessor with the significant advantage of Canon's true optical, lens-shift image stabilization system that yields up to a full four stops of image-shake correction.Fully compatible with over 60 EF/EF-S Lenses and a wide range of EOS System accessoriesEOS Rebel XSi is compatible with all Canon lenses in the EF and EF-S lineup, ranging from ultra-wide angle to super telephoto lenses. Canon lenses employ advanced optical expertise and micron-precision engineering to deliver unprecedented performance in all facets of the photographic process.

A1QTHVA826XEOS,B00F3F0EIU,Super Mum,"[4, 9]","The GoPro Hero has been marketed as the ultimate adventure camera. It can handle surfing, scuba, snowboarding, and extreme conditions.  It is lightweight and itty bitty so it can easily be mounted to a surfboard, helmet or your body without weighing you down.  It does work well in these conditions (well, we don't do snow but we have used it in every other condition).Our family has another shockproof/waterproof/etc. camera and these are thing things I am not as fond of with the Hero3+ Silver:-  No zoom.  Usually ""entry level"" waterproof cameras don't have optical zoom but most typically have digital zoom.  Yes, digital zoom isn't amazing but the option should at least be there to get a better shot of the subject matter.  Often times I had too much landscape and not enough of the object I was hoping to capture.  This can also make for a less focused picture on the desired target.-  Pieces!  My other camera has a battery door that is connected, it also has a door for the charging port that is connected.  The Hero3+ has neither.  The teeny tiny little pieces of plastic are hard to find and the charging door must be removed during charging or hooking up to a computer.  I haven't lost one permanently YET. I'm sure it is only a matter of time. I spent a good half hour looking for the charging door the other day.-  This is a small complaint as it seems most electronic manufacturers are going this way but it does not come with an AC adapter. It comes with a USB cord that can be plugged into a computer but you will have to swipe an AC adapter from another company that didn't try to save a couple of bucks.-  No screen to view photos.  I'm torn about this one.  A screen would likely increase the size of the camera thus making it less ""mountable."" However, when snorkeling, scuba diving, floating down a river, etc. I often like to check the photo to make sure I got the whole fish/turtle/group on inner tubes  in the shot.  I would recommend not using this camera for the first time during something extremely important to you (your first dive in Hawaii).  Play with it first. Get to know it.  Be cognizant of how much it captures (width/height).  Play with how you hold it or where you mount it to determine how you need to position your body/arm to capture the photo/video you want.-  Battery does not last nearly as long as my other camera. I usually get around an hour of constant use.The upside to the Hero3+ Silver:-  Size. As mentioned before, its size is what makes it mountable on just about anything.-  Wide angle lens captures a great amount of the landscape (though see no-zoom above... sometimes too much landscape and not enough of the subject).-  App works flawlessly.  My other waterproof/shockproof camera did not have onboard WiFi and I remedied this with a EyeFi.  It was always dropping connection and never seemed to want to transfer when I needed it to.  Not having to rely on a third party app and hardware is nice.-  Mounting options. There are a ton of great accessories (sold separately) for this product that truly make it versatile to whatever your needs are.-  Waterproof up to 131'.

There are sacrifices...,1385337600,"11 25, 2013","The GoPro Hero has been marketed as the ultimate adventure camera. It can handle surfing, scuba, snowboarding, and extreme conditions. It is lightweight and itty bitty so it can easily be mounted to a surfboard, helmet or your body without weighing you down. It does work well in these conditions (well, we don't do snow but we have used it in every other condition).Our family has another shockproof/waterproof/etc. camera and these are thing things I am not as fond of with the Hero3+ Silver:- No zoom. Usually ""entry level"" waterproof cameras don't have optical zoom but most typically have digital zoom. Yes, digital zoom isn't amazing but the option should at least be there to get a better shot of the subject matter. Often times I had too much landscape and not enough of the object I was hoping to capture. This can also make for a less focused picture on the desired target.- Pieces! My other camera has a battery door that is connected, it also has a door for the charging port that is connected. The Hero3+ has neither. The teeny tiny little pieces of plastic are hard to find and the charging door must be removed during charging or hooking up to a computer. I haven't lost one permanently YET. I'm sure it is only a matter of time. I spent a good half hour looking for the charging door the other day.- This is a small complaint as it seems most electronic manufacturers are going this way but it does not come with an AC adapter. It comes with a USB cord that can be plugged into a computer but you will have to swipe an AC adapter from another company that didn't try to save a couple of bucks.- No screen to view photos. I'm torn about this one. A screen would likely increase the size of the camera thus making it less ""mountable."" However, when snorkeling, scuba diving, floating down a river, etc. I often like to check the photo to make sure I got the whole fish/turtle/group on inner tubes in the shot. I would recommend not using this camera for the first time during something extremely important to you (your first dive in Hawaii). Play with it first. Get to know it. Be cognizant of how much it captures (width/height). Play with how you hold it or where you mount it to determine how you need to position your body/arm to capture the photo/video you want.- Battery does not last nearly as long as my other camera. I usually get around an hour of constant use.The upside to the Hero3+ Silver:- Size. As mentioned before, its size is what makes it mountable on just about anything.- Wide angle lens captures a great amount of the landscape (though see no-zoom above... sometimes too much landscape and not enough of the subject).- App works flawlessly. My other waterproof/shockproof camera did not have onboard WiFi and I remedied this with a EyeFi. It was always dropping connection and never seemed to want to transfer when I needed it to. Not having to rely on a third party app and hardware is nice.- Mounting options. There are a ton of great accessories (sold separately) for this product that truly make it versatile to whatever your needs are.- Waterproof up to 131'.

A20WS8TZ5840ND,B0006HU49Y,"Adam Dachis ""adachis""","[4, 4]","I am, and always have been, simply enamored with the Mac mini.  When Apple tends to ""innovate,"" they create some amazing feats or engineering for a price most cannot afford.  What I find wonderful about the mini is that while it is priced higher than I feel it ought to be (by $100-200) and has its share of shortcomings, it's such a pleasant and surprisingly powerful machine that's also affordable.  I think true innovation comes when you can not only make something new and exciting but also make it accessible.  The Mac mini gives you a fast computer in a tiny, pleasing package for a reasonable price.The mini is really an anomaly in Apple's product line.  Aside from receiving hardware updates less often than any other machine Apple produces, it's one of the few that has received updates with customer wishes in mind.  When Apple moved the mini to Intel, they added gigabit ethernet and additional USB ports (for a total of four).  They re-engineered the machine to handle more RAM.  Things like Bluetooth and Airport became standard (and likely helped Apple justify the price jump).  Having owned a Mac mini G4, the move to Intel was welcome and incredibly impressive.  The mini can accomplish so much more than you'd expect in such a tiny package.  Once, in a bind, I took an older version of this machine (the 1.66 Core Duo) and set it up as a Final Cut editing station.  It worked admirably.  I use my mini as a media server and not as a typical computer, but when I have it's performed far beyond my expectations.However you're using the mini, the number of USB ports included is relevant.  While not necessarily something to be praised, as Apple is notorious for including too few ports on their machines, the mini has more USB ports than any other Mac in the current lineup.  With Firewire 400 and gigabit ethernet, wired connectivity is very good--especially for such a tiny machine.  Wireless connectivity is unfortunately not as good, as no draft 802.11n wireless is available without buying a third-party device.  This is odd, considering Apple's introduction of 802.11n into the majority of its machines before the mini was refreshed to this current version.  One would hope that oversight would be corrected in a subsequent revision.As with any Mac, you get the latest operating system and the iLife suite.  Being a long-time Mac users, I still find this important.  While, admittedly, I don't use iLife to the extent some do, applications that I still do use (such as iPhoto) are always welcome.  While I don't edit in iMovie, I'm still impressed with the simplicity of the product.  With the 2009 update, it's really wonderful.  I also enjoy Garageband.  While I do most of my music work in Cubase, Garageband is an extremely capable tool and I've used it exclusively, in a few cases, for what it can offer.  Apple touts the software suite they include with all their Macs.  If your intention is to utilize the sorts of things iLife offers, it's an incredibly important feature of Macintosh computers.Focusing on the mini, itself, there are still a few unaddressed problems.  The most glaring issue is the outdated hardware.  While the stale mini (that is the focus of this review) is still a very capable machine, the lack of newer wireless technology, computational and graphics processors, and sufficient RAM is a hindrance.  While the CPU in both models of the mini is certainly sufficient for everyday, and even complex, tasks, it falls far short of what it could be at the same price point.  Asking $599 was reasonable for awhile, but it's not anymore when the opportunity to include far more powerful processors is cost-effective.  Additionally, with Apple's recent marriage of Intel CPUs and NVIDIA's newer graphics hardware, the mini has the opportunity to be far more powerful device in gaming and graphics applications.  When Apple releases OS X 10.6 (Snow Leopard) this year, the mini will not be able to take advantage of the performance boosts the new version of the OS offers without something more powerful than the Intel integrated graphics currently implemented in this version of the mini.  Also, 1GB of RAM is sufficient for reasonable use but most people will find it limiting and the main cause of the dreaded pinwheel.  The mini works quite well with 2GB of RAM.  Given the demands of Leopard (OS X 10.5) and the RAM sharing imposed by the integrated graphics, 2GB ought to be the new standard for all Macs.  It certainly seems to be the direction Apple is heading.  Speaking of lacking capacity, an 80GB hard drive is silly.  While the mini never promised large storage capacities, being a machine that is all-around small, it's hard to find anything offering a hard drive smaller than 160GB.  Leave it to Apple to fall behind in disk space and RAM and they won't disappoint, but this is silly even for them.  While the mini is a machine you should generally buy with the idea of adding external storage, an 80GB drive wasn't terribly realistic when this refresh came about.  It's certainly not realistic now.  Lastly, the idea of offering a machine without a DVD burner nowadays is just silly.  It was silly years ago, but now there's just no real cost difference.  This should be a standard as well, and the price difference between the two models should exist in processor speed, the amount of RAM and hard drive capacity.Despite all of these shortcoming, the mini is a phenomenal machine.  You absolutely have to think about what you tend to do with it before choosing the low end model or the high end model, or even another type of machine entirely.  As a primary computer, the mini isn't for everyone.  However, at the price point, if you can afford it you should find it difficult to not find a place in your life for such a pleasant little machine.  I've owned each iteration of the mini and found them to be extremely useful and reliable.  I love these machines.  Despite what Apple can and should do to improve them, they are wonderful pieces of equipment.  The mini is my favorite Apple computer.  It makes the Mac accessible to more people and I think that's Apple's greatest innovation.",4.0,Incredibly charming,1231632000,"01 11, 2009","I am, and always have been, simply enamored with the Mac mini. When Apple tends to ""innovate,"" they create some amazing feats or engineering for a price most cannot afford. What I find wonderful about the mini is that while it is priced higher than I feel it ought to be (by $100-200) and has its share of shortcomings, it's such a pleasant and surprisingly powerful machine that's also affordable. I think true innovation comes when you can not only make something new and exciting but also make it accessible. The Mac mini gives you a fast computer in a tiny, pleasing package for a reasonable price.The mini is really an anomaly in Apple's product line. Aside from receiving hardware updates less often than any other machine Apple produces, it's one of the few that has received updates with customer wishes in mind. When Apple moved the mini to Intel, they added gigabit ethernet and additional USB ports (for a total of four). They re-engineered the machine to handle more RAM. Things like Bluetooth and Airport became standard (and likely helped Apple justify the price jump). Having owned a Mac mini G4, the move to Intel was welcome and incredibly impressive. The mini can accomplish so much more than you'd expect in such a tiny package. Once, in a bind, I took an older version of this machine (the 1.66 Core Duo) and set it up as a Final Cut editing station. It worked admirably. I use my mini as a media server and not as a typical computer, but when I have it's performed far beyond my expectations.However you're using the mini, the number of USB ports included is relevant. While not necessarily something to be praised, as Apple is notorious for including too few ports on their machines, the mini has more USB ports than any other Mac in the current lineup. With Firewire 400 and gigabit ethernet, wired connectivity is very good--especially for such a tiny machine. Wireless connectivity is unfortunately not as good, as no draft 802.11n wireless is available without buying a third-party device. This is odd, considering Apple's introduction of 802.11n into the majority of its machines before the mini was refreshed to this current version. One would hope that oversight would be corrected in a subsequent revision.As with any Mac, you get the latest operating system and the iLife suite. Being a long-time Mac users, I still find this important. While, admittedly, I don't use iLife to the extent some do, applications that I still do use (such as iPhoto) are always welcome. While I don't edit in iMovie, I'm still impressed with the simplicity of the product. With the 2009 update, it's really wonderful. I also enjoy Garageband. While I do most of my music work in Cubase, Garageband is an extremely capable tool and I've used it exclusively, in a few cases, for what it can offer. Apple touts the software suite they include with all their Macs. If your intention is to utilize the sorts of things iLife offers, it's an incredibly important feature of Macintosh computers.Focusing on the mini, itself, there are still a few unaddressed problems. The most glaring issue is the outdated hardware. While the stale mini (that is the focus of this review) is still a very capable machine, the lack of newer wireless technology, computational and graphics processors, and sufficient RAM is a hindrance. While the CPU in both models of the mini is certainly sufficient for everyday, and even complex, tasks, it falls far short of what it could be at the same price point. Asking $599 was reasonable for awhile, but it's not anymore when the opportunity to include far more powerful processors is cost-effective. Additionally, with Apple's recent marriage of Intel CPUs and NVIDIA's newer graphics hardware, the mini has the opportunity to be far more powerful device in gaming and graphics applications. When Apple releases OS X 10.6 (Snow Leopard) this year, the mini will not be able to take advantage of the performance boosts the new version of the OS offers without something more powerful than the Intel integrated graphics currently implemented in this version of the mini. Also, 1GB of RAM is sufficient for reasonable use but most people will find it limiting and the main cause of the dreaded pinwheel. The mini works quite well with 2GB of RAM. Given the demands of Leopard (OS X 10.5) and the RAM sharing imposed by the integrated graphics, 2GB ought to be the new standard for all Macs. It certainly seems to be the direction Apple is heading. Speaking of lacking capacity, an 80GB hard drive is silly. While the mini never promised large storage capacities, being a machine that is all-around small, it's hard to find anything offering a hard drive smaller than 160GB.

There was still a little room left on the end of the belt, so I know it would have fit a somewhat larger arm (the package states the max arm size is 17"").  The elastic has just the right amount of stretch to hold the band securely in place.  It looks like the smallest bicep this thing will handle is about 9.5 inches.

It took me all of 5 seconds to see that the plastic flap on the armband fit between the iPod belt clip and the iPod body (there are no instructions included).  Then, you push the iPod gently until it snaps into the plastic frame on the armband.  No fuss, no muss and the iPod Gen 6 is locked in tight, and I do mean tight as in totally secure - unless you yank it out with the headphone wire.  The only thing I can think of that may have caused people to loose their iPods from this unit is that they were using the iPod belt clip to clip the unit onto the back of the plastic frame which would easily allow the unit to work loose and fall off.

BUTwe noticed that a squeaking/rattling noise would come from the CPU after starting it when the computer was cold. After about 15 seconds, the noise would stop. Two weeks later, the noise would last about 30 seconds and stop.Called customer support who walked me through the process of taking out the memory cards and clicking them back in. Didn't help. Called them several times. I determined that the noise was coming from a fan on a card. They told me the only way to fix the computer was to send it in. I sent it in for repair.Besides the noise, the computer has been great. However, it is a big inconvenience to have to send the computer in and wait (2-3 weeks?).

This player does not come with an installation CD, the purchaser needs to go to the Zune website to download the Zune software to their computer in order to transfer music, podcasts, videos, and games to their Zune. An instruction leaflet is included, and gives basic directions for setup. For more or specific help, go to the Zune website.Other reviewers have discussed the basic features, so I'll give my opinion on the apps. The previous Zune generation didn't include the ability to download apps from the Zune Marketplace, this is a new feature. It's easy to download media and apps from the Zune Marketplace (internet connection required), the apps include a lot of games that will appeal to school-age boys----space battle, race car game, chess, and a number of other choices.Another great app for school-agers is the calculator app. The calculator has several modes, you can choose from a basic calculator or calculator with more functions for accounting, science, etc. After downloading the calculator app to the Zune and bringing up the basic calculator on the touch screen, you can change the calculator from basic to detailed by tilting the Zune. Tilting the Zune will also change the layout from portrait to landscape---nice option, people with large hands will appreciate the ability to change the layout to landscape mode for a wider calculator.Another new feature on the HD is the ability to change the video view---you can touch a 4-way arrow on the viewscreen while watching a video to set the view to fullscreen, or you can let it play normal mode, not filling the screen. The fullscreen view is really nice.The Zune does not include a plug-in wall charger, it does include the cable for attaching the Zune to the computer and charging it via computer USB port. My personal opinion is that the wall-charger is more convenient. The wall charger is about $30 at the big-box stores.One last (important) reason I like the Zune brand is because of reliability---I teach dance classes and I use my MP3 player daily both for class playlists and personal use, and every other MP3 brand I've owned has broken and needed replacement after 1 year, and I had some that didn't even last that long. I currently own the previous generation Zune, and am amazed that it's still going strong and the battery life is still good after a couple of years of heavy use and being dropped on the floor more times than I can count---it's set a record for reliability among the MP3's I've owned.

They push the leading edge of lens-making in their effort to provide the ""glass"" that makes the world's greatest pictures.AF Nikkor lenses work with Nikon SLRs for optimal performance, even the very latest. The Nikon 80-200mm f2.8D ED AF is a superb 2.5x telephoto zoom for sports, portraits, and nature photography. With a fast and constant f2.8 maximum aperture through the entire focal range, ED glass elements provide high-resolution and high-contrast image even at maximum aperture. The rotating zoom ring provides precise zoom operation.ED glass: An essential element of Nikkor telephoto lensesNikon developed ED (Extra-low Dispersion) glass to enable the production of lenses that offer superior sharpness and color correction by minimizing chromatic aberration. Put simply, chromatic aberration is a type of image and color dispersion that occurs when light rays of varying wavelengths pass through optical glass. In the past, correcting this problem for telephoto lenses required special optical elements that offer anomalous dispersion characteristics--specifically calcium fluoride crystals. However, fluorite easily cracks and is sensitive to temperature changes that can adversely affect focusing by altering the lens' refractive index. So Nikon designers and engineers put their heads together and came up with ED glass, which offers all the benefits and none of the drawbacks of calcium fluorite-based glass. With this innovation, Nikon developed several types of ED glass suitable for various lenses. They deliver stunning sharpness and contrast even at their largest apertures. In this way, Nikkor's ED-series lenses exemplify Nikon's preeminence in lens innovation and performance.Nikon Super Integrated Coating ensures exceptional performanceTo enhance the performance of its optical lens elements, Nikon employs an exclusive multilayer lens coating that helps reduce ghost and flare to a negligible level. Nikon Super Integrated Coating achieves a number of objectives, including minimized reflection in the wider wavelength range and superior color balance and reproduction. Nikon Super Integrated Coating is especially effective for lenses with a large number of elements, like our Zoom-Nikkors. Also, Nikon's multilayer coating process is tailored to the design of each particular lens. The number of coatings applied to each lens element is carefully calculated to match the lens type and glass used, and also to assure the uniform color balance that characterizes Nikkor lenses. This results in lenses that meet much higher standards than the rest of the industry.Distance informationD-type and G-type Nikkors relay subject-to-camera distance information to AF Nikon camera bodies.

They push the leading edge of lens-making in their effort to provide the ""glass"" that makes the world's greatest pictures.AF Nikkor lenses work with Nikon SLRs for optimal performance, even the very latest. The Nikon 80-200mm f2.8D ED AF is a superb 2.5x telephoto zoom for sports, portraits, and nature photography. With a fast and constant f2.8 maximum aperture through the entire focal range, ED glass elements provide high-resolution and high-contrast image even at maximum aperture. The rotating zoom ring provides precise zoom operation.ED glass: An essential element of Nikkor telephoto lensesNikon developed ED (Extra-low Dispersion) glass to enable the production of lenses that offer superior sharpness and color correction by minimizing chromatic aberration. Put simply, chromatic aberration is a type of image and color dispersion that occurs when light rays of varying wavelengths pass through optical glass. In the past, correcting this problem for telephoto lenses required special optical elements that offer anomalous dispersion characteristics--specifically calcium fluoride crystals. However, fluorite easily cracks and is sensitive to temperature changes that can adversely affect focusing by altering the lens' refractive index. So Nikon designers and engineers put their heads together and came up with ED glass, which offers all the benefits and none of the drawbacks of calcium fluorite-based glass. With this innovation, Nikon developed several types of ED glass suitable for various lenses. They deliver stunning sharpness and contrast even at their largest apertures. In this way, Nikkor's ED-series lenses exemplify Nikon's preeminence in lens innovation and performance.Nikon Super Integrated Coating ensures exceptional performanceTo enhance the performance of its optical lens elements, Nikon employs an exclusive multilayer lens coating that helps reduce ghost and flare to a negligible level. Nikon Super Integrated Coating achieves a number of objectives, including minimized reflection in the wider wavelength range and superior color balance and reproduction. Nikon Super Integrated Coating is especially effective for lenses with a large number of elements, like our Zoom-Nikkors. Also, Nikon's multilayer coating process is tailored to the design of each particular lens. The number of coatings applied to each lens element is carefully calculated to match the lens type and glass used, and also to assure the uniform color balance that characterizes Nikkor lenses. This results in lenses that meet much higher standards than the rest of the industry.Distance informationD-type and G-type Nikkors relay subject-to-camera distance information to AF Nikon camera bodies.

As the world's most compact full-format system camera, the M9 extends the legendary heritage of the Leica rangefinder M System and unites over 50 years of continuous technical improvements to the system with the best in cutting-edge digital technology.The successful combination of an extremely high-resolution image sensor, the superior performance of M lenses and sophisticated processing of the captured digital information ensures the best imaging results in all photographic situations. With its wide-ranging technical specifications, the camera adjusts to all fields of photography - from reportage and 'available light' to the capture of discreet and fine-art images alike. The M9 is the ideal tool for all photographers who demand the highest standards in image quality and a freedom of composition.The 18-megapixel CCD image sensor, specifically designed and developed for the M9, enables the capture of the full 35-mm film format without any compromises. All M lenses mounted on the Leica M9 therefore offer the same angle of view as with film camera models, meaning the enormous potential performance of the current M lens portfolio with focal lengths from 16 to 135 mm is now fully available in a digital camera for the very first time. In addition, most Leica M lenses built since 1954 can still be used on the new M9. Once again, Leica Camera AG proves their commitment to full system compatibility and the enduring value of the M series.The sensor of the M9 features a newly developed glass cover that is designed to guarantee the suppression of infrared light in practical photography, avoiding the necessity of mounting special UV/IR filters.Concentrating on essentials, its simple handling is a significant feature of the Leica M System. In the case of the Leica M9, the handling has been further improved by simplification of the menu navigation: setting the sensitivity only requires holding down the ISO button while simultaneously turning the dial to select the required setting. All other functions important for everyday situations are quickly and easily accessible by pressing the set button. Furthermore, the menu also offers a snapshot profile option. In this mode, the M9 automatically sets as many settings as possible and provides a valuable aid to spontaneous and discreet photography. The camera also features automatic lens recognition via 6-bit coding. On the basis of the coded information, the M9 can compensate for any system-inherent lens vignetting effects (darkening in the image corners).Despite the considerably larger sensor, Leica has been successful in making the Leica M9 body comparable to the compact size typical of M cameras. With its compact dimensions of only 139 × 37 × 80 mm (5.47 × 1.45 × 3.15 inches), the Leica M9 maintains the ideal size of the M series and is now the world's smallest full-format digital system camera.As a working tool for professionals and ambitious amateur photographers, all features and functions of the Leica M9 are designed for absolute dependability and endurance. The one-piece, full-metal housing is made from a high-strength magnesium alloy. Additionally, the top deck and bottom plate are machined from solid brass blocks providing perfect protection for the precious inner mechanisms. The digital components and shutter assembly of the M9 are similarly constructed with extreme endurance in mind. For photographers, this means absolute reliability for decades of use.Leica M9 Features and HighlightsThe sensorThe CCD sensor specially developed by Kodak for the Leica M9 has been optimised to fully exploit the particular qualities of the Leica M lens system. As a result, the Leica M9 achieves highest resolution values that guarantee outstanding image quality. The image sensor of the M9 employs further-advanced and meticulously designed micro lenses with a low refractive index. The micro lenses at the sensor edges are laterally displaced towards the image center to precisely match the characteristics of M lenses. This optimized micro lens design, based on many years of precision optical engineering experience, captures and concentrates even the most oblique rays on the sensor and reliably prevents image brightness fall-off at the edges and corners of the image. As a result, all existing Leica M lenses maintain their full performance when used for digital photography.The intentional decision to exclude a moiré filter, which optically filters out the finest image details, was made to permit full the exploitation of the superb resolution of Leica M lenses. Any moiré patterns occurring with the M9 are eliminated in the camera's digital signal-processing software. The optimized signal-noise ratio of the CCD image sensor reduces the need for digital post-processing and ensures that images possess an unrivaled, natural visual impact. This results in high-contrast, particularly high-resolution exposures with natural color rendition from corner to corner.The lensesAll Leica M lenses mounted on the Leica M9 offer the same angle of view as with film camera models. Therefore, for the first time, the immense performance potential of the lenses is now maintained and can be fully exploited for digital photography. In line with Leica's renowned commitment to extreme system compatibility, most Leica M lenses built since 1954 can be used on the new M9. As a result of the high mechanical and optical precision and extraordinarily good imaging performance, and particularly that of the current range, Leica M lenses are now ideal for use in digital photography. Performance criteria, such as the individual coating of each element, have long been a Leica standard, and there was no need to develop and implement any special measures for 'digital lenses.'The efficient image sensor on the M9 demands a particularly high spatial resolution that is, above all, offered by the latest M lenses. The excellent correction of optical aberrations and high resolution make them all the more suitable for digital use. The current M lenses are supplied with a 6-bit code on the bayonet mount that is scanned optically by the M9. On the basis of the coded information, the M9 can compensate for any (almost negligible) system-inherent vignetting effects if necessary. In addition, the lens type is recorded in the EXIF data of the image files and, when using the latest flash units like the Leica SF 58, automatically adjusts the reflector to match the focal length of the lens attached.The viewfinder/rangefinderThe Leica viewfinder / rangefinder system sets the Leica M9 apart from the market-dominating SLR and compact digital cameras and makes it particularly suitable for vibrant reportage photography, 'available light' exposures and discreet portraiture. Photographers become part of the action and frame whatever they wish to capture in the viewfinder--a scene, a mood, a moment. Simultaneously, the photographer still perceives what is going on outside the viewfinder frame. The decisive moment can be anticipated, and can therefore be captured at precisely the right instant. This results in particularly authentic images that are not impaired by the presence of the photographer.The clear view of the subject remains even during exposure and, even in the most adverse lighting conditions, the bright, high-contrast viewfinder guarantees extremely fast and precise focusing. In combination with the minimal delay between releasing the shutter and capturing the shot--in digital photography too--the combined viewfinder/rangefinder system positions Leica M cameras among the fastest cameras in the world.In contrast to SLR photography, where focusing must take place through the lens and focal length and aperture determine focusing accuracy, the rangefinder base of the Leica M remains precisely the same and independent of the actual lens being used. This is the reason why its focusing precision is immensely superior for shorter focal lengths. The high-contrast, rectangular RF spot in the center of the viewfinder guarantees fast, precise and pin-sharp focusing, even under adverse lighting conditions.The frame selector lever allows photographers to simulate different compositions with alternative focal lengths and assess the most appropriate lens for the shot without changing lenses. Because their position is automatically adjusted by automatic parallax compensation depending on the focusing distance, the six different bright-line frames always show the precise image framing. The bright-line viewfinder shows all other information relevant to the capture of a perfect image and the peripheral area around the envisaged subject, thus providing ideal conditions for spontaneous and unobtrusive photography.The shutterThe Leica M9 features a new, microprocessor-controlled, particularly silent, metal-leaf, focal-plane shutter that enables shutter speeds of up to 1/4000 seconds. This allows the photographer to maintain complete creative freedom by using a selective focus at maximum apertures, even in bright situations. The short flash synchronisation speed of 1/180 seconds enables daylight flash exposures with selective focus.Together with its compact form, the camera's virtually silent shutter is another keystone for discreet and unobtrusive photography. Additionally, photographers can select the appropriate moment for re-cocking the shutter. When longer exposure times requiring an extremely steady camera stance are essential, a slight pressure on the shutter release button in 'soft release' mode is sufficient.Intuitive handlingThe Leica M9 concentrates the photographer's attention on photographic essentials, not on setting the camera. Particular diligence, many years of experience and a vast knowledge of how professional photographers work have all influenced the handling concept for the digital functions of the Leica M9. The result is a simple, clearly laid-out and intuitive user interface that concentrates purely on essentials; multifunction buttons and complex menu hierarchies have been avoided.The key control element is an intuitive four-way switch and dial combination that enables fast menu navigation. Pressing the 'set' button activates the capture parameter menu on the 2.5-inch monitor screen. The most important image-capture settings are quickly and easily set in this menu: sensor sensitivity, exposure correction, white balance, image-data compression and resolution. Free profile storage spaces are also available for fast access to frequently used or application-specific combinations. The menu button is also used for changing more permanent, values outlining basic controls in the clearly structured system menu. The photographer can also choose whether the captured image is displayed immediately for assessment on the large monitor, how long it should be displayed and whether an additional tonal value histogram is shown.The Leica M9 has a delayed shutter release function with a choice of two countdown times -2 and 12 seconds.The technical features of the Leica M9 allow it to quickly adapt to its intended use. Its sensitivity ranges from ISO 160 (PULL 80) for wide-open apertures on bright days to ISO 2500. At the same time, very low noise and finely detailed images are achieved throughout the sensitivity range, even at the highest settings. The very low noise characteristics, a bright viewfinder / rangefinder, low-vibration shutter and fast lenses make the M9 the perfect camera for 'available light' photography.Innovative flash technologyThe M-TTL flash technology in the Leica M9 enables both precise and creative control over flash and mixed lighting effects. Prior to the actual exposure, a measuring flash is emitted that is metered through the lens. The flash power is then precisely determined with consideration for the natural lighting conditions, ensuring that natural lighting is maintained as much as possible In combination with the aperture priority exposure mode, the auto-slow sync function ensures subtle lighting of the subject, whereby the longest shutter speed may be set manually or, when using 6-bit coded lenses, automatically, according to the 1/focal length rule of thumb.Image assessment with the tonal value histogramAs a professional digital camera, the Leica M9 naturally offers an RGB tonal value histogram, which can be displayed at any time for the assessment of stored images. This feature is also available in conjunction with the automatic image review function. A useful additional aid is the indication of overexposed image areas by means of a so-called 'clipping warning.' These two quality control tools are updated for enlarged views and thus allow the quality of even the finest image details to be assessed. Pressing the info function button displays all photographically relevant settings, including additional metadata stored in the image files. These functions enable full control over captured results at the shooting location of the digital images.Digital workflowThe M9 comes with Adobe Photoshop Lightroom, a professional digital workflow solution for Apple Mac OS X and Microsoft Windows. The software is available as an online download for all Leica M9 customers. This also ensures that the latest release is always readily available. Adobe Photoshop Lightroom offers a vast range of functions for the management, processing and presentation of digital images, quite independent of image format. If the images from the M9 are saved as raw data in the standardized and future-proof Adobe Digital Negative Format (DNG), Adobe Photoshop Lightroom, with its sophisticated and precise processing options, guarantees direct and extremely high-quality image processing with maximized image quality. The 14-bit-per-channel color information captured by the image sensor is then processed at a16-bit-per-channel color information until the final presentation, and ensures that the most delicate tonal differentiations are preserved in maximum quality after completion of the post-processing sequence.Materials, finish and dimensionsThe tough and resilient top deck and base plate of the M9 are machined from solid brass blocks, while the full-metal body is manufactured from a high-strength magnesium alloy that ensures a long and reliable professional working life. The rechargeable battery and the SD card slot are protected from dust and moisture under the base plate, which uses a specialized locking mechanism effectively preventing unintentional opening and the subsequent loss of the battery and SD card. In addition, this long-established construction concept, already employed for decades in the Leica M System, significantly increases the structural stability of the camera body.The experienced technicians at the Leica factory in Solms, Germany are responsible for the hand-assembly and hand-calibration of M9 bodies and the precise testing of all mechanical and electrical components. The experience gathered over decades of maintenance and repairs by Leica Customer Service creates a solid foundation for long life and enduring value. Even today, the service department maintains and repairs all M cameras built since 1954.Sensor cleaningThe Leica M9 offers a special function for manual sensor cleaning: selecting the appropriate item from the menu and pressing the shutter release locks the shutter open to allow access to the sensor for cleaning purposes. Due to the short register of Leica M cameras, the sensor is easier to access than in DSLR cameras in which the sensors are located behind the mirror box and shutter assembly.What's in the BoxBattery charger 100-240 V with two power cords (Euro, USA, may differ for other export markets) and one car charging cable, lithium-ion battery, USB cable, carrying strap",,Leica,Camera & Photo,Digital Cameras,Amazon,2013,5,5,4889,0.9203689759036144,2,3,0.6666666666666666,768,0.025346613282154793,4.0190099599616165,4.666666666666667,0.5773502691896257,3,3,5.0,0.0,1,1,"Leica M9 18MP Digital Range Finder Camera (Black, Body Only) Digital photography enters a new dimension: the Leica M9 is the world's first digital rangefinder camera with a full-format 24 x 36 mm sensor.

Due to the short register of Leica M cameras, the sensor is easier to access than in DSLR cameras in which the sensors are located behind the mirror box and shutter assembly.What's in the BoxBattery charger 100-240 V with two power cords (Euro, USA, may differ for other export markets) and one car charging cable, lithium-ion battery, USB cable, carrying strap",1667,2065

A923XAL9UCXIL,B00AA04LUA,Ranty,"[315, 337]","This is a very well designed and well manufactured tablet that has great looks, some very nice tablet apps (including most of the biggies you could want: Hulu, Netflix, Fruit Ninja!). Where it really shines is when you need to stop playing with a toy and get some real work done. That's when the kickstand and the touch cover(or better yet, the type cover), plus the legacy windows desktop save your bacon.The included version of Office 2013 gets the job done in real office, not some lousy app store wanna-be. That means you get perfect compatibility with work documents, say, on your sharepoint server workflow. You can't run macros/VBA on this version, and there are a few things you can't do in excel on this version, but I am a very VBA/macro-heavy user of Office and a poweruser of excel, and honestly, I don't miss that stuff that much. (If you must have it, get the ultrabook version, the Surface Pro, which will run regular office, in January).There are a lot of self-pleasuring gadget-geek reviews out there who make much of the dichotomy between the legacy desktop and the tile start screen. They seem to think that you and I are idiots, and that we can't pick the right tool for the right job. (I submit that folks whose ""work"" involves nothing more than writing about gadgets don't have enough real work to understand what a gadget is really good for, but I digress.)The legacy desktop is also very handy for networking and other file-handling jobs, along with computer management via the deeper geek tools like the computer management panel and more. You don't ever have to mess with this stuff if you don't want to, but if you need to, it's there. (For instance, by using the disk management console, you can set up a removable micro SD card to be accessed as if it's a regular part of the music/video/picturs library, meaning you can add 64 gigs of space to those libraries for a mere $50 bucks. You can use the removable storage without adding the location to the library too, but I find it more useful that way.)Because the surface has a full USB hub as well as seemless integration with your home windows network, you can use it as a real tool rather than a gimped toy like other tablets. Got a camera full of raw and jpeg files to review? Stick the card into a reader (or if you want, the Micro SD slot), and an import is automatically initiated by the OS. (Or, you can connect the camera, and because it's windows, and has 18 gazillion drivers, it will simply access the camera. The Surface RT found and communicated with my wierd Fujifilm Finepix x100 with no problem.) Take a peek at the photos, trash the ones you don't want (the metro photos ap only shows jpegs, which is fine, but you can use the desktop side to access the RAW files.) Oh, and you can also install RAW file codecs using windows update on the RT if you want to look at your Canon or other Tiff-based RAW files. Try that with another tablet.Done looking? Send them to your NAS with a simple drag and drop. Or write yourself a batch file to do it if you like. Yeah, you can do those things because it's got the geeky side of windows.As much as I appreciate that side of the OS, I still spend most of the time on the metro side, where there are plenty of decent apps and more every day. On that side, the OS found and installed a working driver for my LOUSY brother network laser printer and I was sending it files in no time. This thing actually finds network devices and installs drivers for them before you even go to look for them. It found my samsung TV in the basement, even. I don't know what it thinks it can do with the TV, but it found it and checked out the possibilities in the background.Integration with stuff like Xbox is amazing. Looking at photos on your surface? Send them to the big TV via Xbox with a quick swipe to the charms.The photo hub is basic but nice, and integrates onboard photos, facebook, skydrive, and flickr. It will even incorporate photos from the libraries of your windows 7 machines if they have the same MSFT login. Again, this was an automatic thing that I found very nice, although I had to shut that off on mine, because my desktop's pictures library is attached to an NAS with a couple hundred thousand images, more than enough to choke the surface's 64 gigs.The people hub is decent but needs improvement to be on par with the Windows phone people hub. Mail is a bit better, but no todos yet, again, behind the same program on windows phone. I expect that stuff will come soon. Xbox music is a great service, and it keeps artists and the collection synced nicely across my phone and windows 7 desktop. There are some other really great windows 8 apps like the weather app, travel (gorgeous images and great first-look info on lots of destinations.) I'm having trouble warming up to the maps application. Again, it feels not quite as polished as the maps app on windows phone. Remote desktop works great, and there's already Teamviewer if you need to hit a machine on another network. (No cisco anyconnect VPN as of now, and Cisco and MSFT are feuding about whether or not it can be done for RT.)The biggest annoyances for me are occasional ""stuck key"" type errors from the keyboard even when I'm not pressing a key. A quick disconnect takes care of that. There are occasional hiccups with apps as well, usually when I forget to shut down and have a dozen of them running at once. All in all, I'd say apps crash on the surface about as frequently as I crash apps on the iPad 3, well, before that became the 3 year-old's new toy.I'd say ignore most of those tech geek reviews, because they don't really get it. Someone who tells you that the platform is limited because there's no spotify hasn't played with it enough to know that there's a service that's arguably better already included. Ditto those who complain about a lack of facebook app -- it's wrapped into the people hub (along with twitter, linkedin, skype, messenger). Moreover, Microsoft has already sold more than 40 million windows 8 licenses, which means developers are going to be producing a ton more windows 8 apps, because the audience for them is already enormous.I was considering holding out for the Surface Pro to take advantage of full windows 8, the ability to use legacy programs, plus inking via the pen, but I don't think I'm going to go that route now that I have the RT. The pro, which runs a laptop chip, will have a laptop's battery life. The RT goes a whole day of intermittant use for me and never gets below half a charge. It's thinner and lighter than the pro will be, and it does almost everything I need. For the few applications that require more horsepower, I simply remote in to another windows machine and get it done that way.I think this is an underappreciated device that deserves a serious look from anyone who wants the conveniences of a tablet, but the ability to get some real work done when necessary.",5.0,A tablet that can actually do some work,1354406400,"12 2, 2012","This is a very well designed and well manufactured tablet that has great looks, some very nice tablet apps (including most of the biggies you could want: Hulu, Netflix, Fruit Ninja!).

Not only is this camera extremely compact while still using the same DSLR-size image sensor found in Olympus DSLRs, but the new auto focus system inside this camera makes it one of the fastest focusing cameras on the market (depending on the lens you're using).The 14-42mm R II kit zoom lens focuses extremely fast and is good enough for casual/vacation use but the real advantage of a camera like the E-P3 is the ability to use interchangeable lenses. My favorite lenses to use with this camera are the Olympus 17mm f/2.8 pancake lens, the Panasonic Leica 25mm f/1.4, and the Olympus 45mm f/1.8 lenses. I also have the 9-18mm zoom lens when I need to have a wide angle lens.

I thought I'd just use the screen to compose my images like any other camera, but I discovered that it's really nice to be able to touch the screen EXACTLY where you want to focus and have the camera instantly take the picture.In any case, the durable metal construction, built-in image stabilization, built-in wireless flash control, and decent 3fps burst shooting mode make the E-P3 a solid DSLR replacement if you're looking for DSLR quality without the bulk.

This lens offers you reasonably sharp photos at a very, very good price. Here's a more indepth evaluation of this lens.- SharpnessThe sharpness is on par with that of the 18-55mm kit lens. In the right conditions, it's almost (but not quite) pro-grade. For a budget lens, it's really about as sharp as they come. I think it's safe to say in terms of sharpness this lens will satisfy all but the most fastidious of prosumers.You best bet for seeing how sharp this lens is is to seek out professional review sites that show you a 100% crop of pictures taken with this lens and then decide for yourself.- Chromatic Aberration (CA)In bright sunlight, where chromatic aberration is most pronounced, the chromatic aberration on this lens is barely noticeable and probably imperceptible to the untrained eye. In more even lighting, this lens shows no signs of CA.- Auto-Focus (AF)The auto-focus is fast enough for still subjects, but for very fast-moving subjects, it's a hit-or-miss. I gave this lens a good workout shooting cheetahs running close to their top speeds at the Animal Ark, Reno, NV (OT: cheetahs can run at speeds of 70 mph or greater). Most of my shots came out blurry (and that's not due to motion blur) because the auto-focus wasn't fast enough.Like the kit lens, the auto-focus has trouble in lowlight conditions. It also has trouble with surfaces that lack texture. The motor whirs back and forth trying to lock on to a focus. It can be a little annoying at times.- Image Stabilization (IS)The image stabilization is amazing, even at 250mm. Interestingly, you can hear a click when the image stabilization mechanism kicks in. For handheld shot, especially at the 250mm end, the IS is immensely helpful for steadying your shots. I'm very impressed. (Bear in mind, too, the rule of thumb: the shutter speed should be at least as fast as the reciprocal of the focal length.)- Internal Focus (IF)The lack of IF would not ordinarily be a problem unless you're using circular polarized filters. The turning of the barrel throws the filter out of adjustment, so you would have to readjust the filter after the subject is brought into focus.- BuildIn terns of build quality, the lens is built a lot like the kit lens. There are complaints that it looks plasticky - maybe so - but it doesn't look cheap to be sure. It's lightweight but it feels well-built and sturdy. The zoom ring feels tight, but not overly so, so there is no zoom creep.- AlternativeJust FYI, theCanon EF 70-300mmis reputed to be sharper than this lens.

This allows the end user to tune the speaker system with no concerns for any accidental control adjustments. Finally, the newly designed S-220 advantages improved acoustics for a smoother, rich experience to enjoy music, VoIP discussions or playing video games.What's in the box: Logitech S-220 Speaker System, Subwoofer, 2 x Satellite Speakers, Wired Remote Control, All Necessary Cables, Setup Guide and 3-year Manufacturer's Warranty",3030,1034

It does not turn down by itself when you re-pair it to a new device, nor does it give you the ability turn down the volume without a source connected.

ASM34MBSYVG6D,B00192NV0Y,Amazon Customer,"[5, 7]","It's an okay product, based on the hour or so I spent experimenting with it. As others have noted the feel of the plastic is sort of ""cheap"" in some hard to describe way - it's built solidly enough, it just has some ""off"" sort of hollow tactile quality to it, akin to the feel of a plastic sunshade when removed from the lens. But it's pretty minor, I wouldn't even notice it after using it a while.What I didn't like was that time lapses are inexplicably limited to 99 frames. I've been looking at this product off and on for three months, and until checked before writing this review did NOT see that fact listed (it is, I should have seen it). Since that number of frames limits time lapse clips to 3-4 seconds at 24-30fps, it is so restrictive that it renders the function useless, at least for my interests.The function (non-shutter) buttons were very difficult for me to push. I have large hands, but I don't think that's the only reason - each is recessed in a dimple, and has to be pushed further than I was able to do without careful application of the corner of a fingernail. Such buttons would be fine for setting date and time on a clock, but not for functions requiring frequent adjustments - they need to be larger or have a shorter travel distance. This only compounds the frustration one experiences with trying to experiment with the function settings while deciphering the instructions. It took me nearly ten minutes just to get the internal clock set. One then has to cycle through all the functions in the unit to set up a time lapse shot, and the settings are not stored when the unit is powered off (meaning the settings have to be painstakingly and frustratingly set again each time).PROS: stores removed battery cover, pretty stout internal mechanisms for battery and AA-clip retention and release, pretty simple to install, fits the camera body tightly and neatly, changed grip of camera as a whole feels natural right off, inexpensive.CONS: limitation of time lapse function to a useless (for me) 99 frames, nearly indecipherable instructions, difficult to access main buttons, poorly laid out and non-intuitive user interface in function access (too many buttons to push, too many settings to cycle through), vaguely ""plasticky"" tactile quality, dials feel clunky (but may just need some use to smooth out), need to manually turn the unit on and off (why can't this be linked to the body's power switch?).",3.0,Note the 99-Frames Limitation on Time Lapses,1258329600,"11 16, 2009","It's an okay product, based on the hour or so I spent experimenting with it.

The charging cable is unique to the device, so if you want to travel with this drive you'll need to carry that cable in addition to all your other cables.

There is a plastic end cap on the drive that you need to remove and replace with an adapter to attach the drive to a USB port, and the attachment cable isn't standard. So there are a lot of pieces to keep track of.

I really don't see carrying a drive twice the size of my phone to provide extra storage for my phone. And, while they suggest using it with a laptop, I can't see using a Wi-Fi drive with anything you can use a USB cable to plug a (smaller, cheaper) drive into.The drive comes with test documents on it, but I used the USB cable to transfer some additional files to it from my desktop. That generally went smoothly. After attaching the drive to my computer I got a message saying I needed to reboot before using the drive, but I didn't and it worked fine. After downloading the appropriate, free, app* to my Fire I had no trouble attaching to the drive. Doing so knocked me off my home Wi-Fi network. In theory you can then have the drive attach to the internet via Wi-Fi, but I wasn't able to do that with my encrypted network.

The Belkin cases tend to be a little thicker than some of the cases offered by other manufacturers and a lot thicker than going with Apple's smart cover. If you're looking to keep the mini sleek, slim, and low profile, this probably isn't the case you're looking for.  If you want adequate thickness to protect the mini during transport or inside of a bag or briefcase, these cases are perfect.  The tab cover has a smooth simulated leather finish with a soft microfiber interior and elastic corner holders for the mini.  It has a magnetic closure that stays pretty secure when closed but the case does not have the smart cover sleep/wake feature.  The magnet is solely for securing the case closed.  It also keeps the back secured out of your way when the case is open.  The case has adjustable slots that enable the mini to stand in landscape mode. The mini feels very secure when propped in landscape mode.  Overall quality of material and construction appears to be very good.  The iPad fits perfect.  I'm not sure why none of the Belkin cases have the smart cover feature but if that's not a deal breaker for you, they are good quality cases.

No manual, but if you have a decent enough technical background you really don't need it. WiFi configuration made it a bit interesting - if you wanted to set up two different SSIDs for your network, you could. In my case I moved my AppleTV and other Apple proudcts to one SSID and kept the other the same as my old SSID.Network speeds:To be honest, I didn't see any real improvement over my transfers between my NAS, my desktops or anything else. That was a bit disappointing, but unless you've got everything at Gigabit Ethernet and Jumbo Frames, you probably won't notice anything. Same with Wifi - I was streaming the same as before.Network drive:The sharing of a USB drive was pretty easy to do - plug in, map the drive and go to town. No DLNA support means game consoles can't see it, and remember that if you have Macs and PCs coexisting, having a NTFS partition on your USB drive means Macs can't copy files to it.Overall I'm torn. This router is pretty slick, and I like having the dual band option so I can segment the network. If you have a poweruser household, that's probably a good option.

This machine is truly a step above the competition in many regards that are important to me.When you receive the machine and setup the built-in wireless (I have ATT uVerse with the router in my room), it immediately does a firmware search to find the file.  It takes approximately 10-15 minutes for it to reboot with the new firmware.  Then you're golden.  You login to the Netflix account and and any other service and you're good to go!The desktop streaming takes a bit to figure out and the instructions are lacking on how to do this after you install the Nero software disc that's supposed to hook you up.  Eventually a pop-up screen user ID/password has to match your computer's and then you have to click into it from the menu.  I had to Google it to find out how to do the desktop to player set-up (apparently there's lots out there with the same problem!). Anyways, once set-up, the streaming is SMOOTH and FLAWLESS with large multi-GB files.  Quality of the digital file seems to be upconverted as the image looks great.  In addition, it works with multichannel files, so if you have 5.1 in the AVI file, it'll play back all channels.  The only issue with streaming in general, (i.e. desktop or Netflix on any disc machine), is that the FW/REW is slow to implement (several seconds lag), but this is ""normal"" for streaming functions these days me-thinks.  Mp3 songs also stream nicely.The Bluray and DVD playback quality is great.  Saturated colors and sharp.  The DVD discs upconvert brilliantly and look almost bluray level!I've read that a few users have had the player burp between chapter breaks on DVD/Bluray playback, but this is not the case with my player.  It plays SMOOTH from beginning to end.  I would suggest anyone that gets a player that does this to EXCHANGE it immediately (hopefully from a different batch!).  I suspect that LG uses different drives/chip from different mfgrs. and thus some may be getting a player with frazzly parts.  I wouldn't wait for some ""oft-promised"" firmware fix (as LG has told some who have this problem) if I knew other users were getting machines that work 110% (like me).Amazingly enough, there's nothing I can really ding this player on except the shoddy instructions on how to set up Desktop computer streaming wirelessly...which can be a PAIN(!!) if you've never done it before.In all, the fact that it can play a host of files from my computer and do everything else very competently sets this model lineup a step above Panasonic and the rest for its feature richness (and is a DAY and NIGHT improvement over the previous buggy Samsung wireless player I had!).  Remember to just do a chapter break test on your new unit and exchange if it stutters on you....then, once you have nag-free player, you should be golden!A word of advice on firmwares.  Once you have a firmware that WORKS, don't download any new ones until you know from other users (avsforum.com) it works 110% and adds something of real value to YOU (i.e. such as Hulu+, etc).

ALRI7LZS1CPA4,B00BHADL3U,Dadeo,"[9, 11]","Update for Trip Planning:I used the Tyre trip planning software that comes with the TomTom for a 1 day 300 mile winding back road drive last week. This software actually worked pretty well. It was easy to quickly plan the trip by using Google maps thru Tyre and transfer it to the TomTom. However, I don't like dirt roads and I could not get Tyre/Google to identify and avoid the dirt roads as I prepared the trip on the computer. Once I downloaded the itinerary to the TomTom, the TomTom told me that several parts of the trip were on dirt roads. I found myself modifying the itinerary just as I was getting ready to leave. I also found that if I placed a waypoint on the wrong side of a divided highway, the TomTom would hit me with an unexpected U-Turn, forcing me to backtrack. It is possible to delete the erroneous waypoint, but I could not find a way to easily relocate it while underway. I learned that one should closely review the trip (and map) created once it is downloaded to the TomTom. Be sure you put way-points on the correct side of the road.Original Review:I bought this after getting disgusted my last GPS's inability to quickly recalculate routes after a missed turn.  I've tested it commuting and on short trips around the area. My previous GPS units have included: the TomTom Rider 1; the Tomtom Rider 2; the Magellan RoadMate and the Worldnav. I ride about 10,000 miles a year, about 75% commuting and driving around northern Virginia in heavy traffic for work and play.What I like about the TomTom Rider 2013- It calculates a route quickly and it recalculates quickly. I won't be driving past the next exit as I wait for the unit to recalculate.- It is easy to see, day or night.  The larger screen is easy to read and it is bright enough to view 95% of the time.- It has very good routing software for a unit without traffic. It calculates the route knowing historical traffic jam patterns, but won't know about any immediate crash or incidents that a live traffic update would have. Unless there is a major crash, the calculated trip arrival times are amazingly accurate -- much more than any previous unit I've owned.- It is amazingly glove friendly. Bogus menu choices are a thing of the past.- I can record and correct errors in map data and I can mark them for future correction as I ride. I have already corrected the speed limit on a highway near my house. This is a longstanding error. The speed limit on this section of highway was increased to 65 MPH about 15 years ago, following a major rebuild and expansion, yet everyone's map software still has the speed limit at 50 MPH -- which is what it was during the construction project. With this unit the stupid speed limit warning is gone.What I don't like:- The mount. Simply put, mine is defective. I've tested the unit with a voltage tester and there is simply not enough power coming out of the contacts on the mount to power up the GPS or charge the battery. Mine is wired directly to the battery and I know it is getting full power. Over the years I've had several GPS units and I've had trouble with the mounts on all of them, but usually the problems appear after a couple of years of vibrations and moisture, not right out of the box. So I have wired mine to the bike by opening the door at the bottom and wiring that to the bike. I have done this to other units, but not immediately. This would be a 5 Star review if not for this issue.",4.0,Good Performance,1380499200,"09 30, 2013","Update for Trip Planning:I used the Tyre trip planning software that comes with the TomTom for a 1 day 300 mile winding back road drive last week.

I won't be driving past the next exit as I wait for the unit to recalculate.- It is easy to see, day or night. The larger screen is easy to read and it is bright enough to view 95% of the time.- It has very good routing software for a unit without traffic. It calculates the route knowing historical traffic jam patterns, but won't know about any immediate crash or incidents that a live traffic update would have. Unless there is a major crash, the calculated trip arrival times are amazingly accurate -- much more than any previous unit I've owned.- It is amazingly glove friendly. Bogus menu choices are a thing of the past.- I can record and correct errors in map data and I can mark them for future correction as I ride. I have already corrected the speed limit on a highway near my house. This is a longstanding error. The speed limit on this section of highway was increased to 65 MPH about 15 years ago, following a major rebuild and expansion, yet everyone's map software still has the speed limit at 50 MPH -- which is what it was during the construction project. With this unit the stupid speed limit warning is gone.What I don't like:- The mount. Simply put, mine is defective. I've tested the unit with a voltage tester and there is simply not enough power coming out of the contacts on the mount to power up the GPS or charge the battery. Mine is wired directly to the battery and I know it is getting full power. Over the years I've had several GPS units and I've had trouble with the mounts on all of them, but usually the problems appear after a couple of years of vibrations and moisture, not right out of the box. So I have wired mine to the bike by opening the door at the bottom and wiring that to the bike. I have done this to other units, but not immediately. This would be a 5 Star review if not for this issue.",Good Performance,2013-09-30,TomTom RIDER Motorcycle GPS Navigator with Lifetime Maps,start aplus content,365.95,TomTom,GPS & Navigation,Vehicle GPS,Amazon,2013,9,0,5017,0.9444653614457831,9,11,0.8181818181818182,3428,0.1133648787267132,3.4986600226813986,4.333333333333333,0.5773502691896257,3,3,4.0,0.0,1,1,TomTom RIDER Motorcycle GPS Navigator with Lifetime Maps start aplus content,3055,4777

There are two stations close to me in southern New Jersey (WNJS and WMGM) that I expected to receive with the antenna, but I had difficulty getting these both to come in at the same time - adjusting for one station caused the other to be marginal or gone altogether.  By comparison, the Terk FDTV1A got both of these stations in strong and clear.In addition, with the Terk I was able to get a usable signal for KYW (CBS), WTXF (Fox), and WPSG (CW) even though these are all over 55 miles away.  (KYW reception was pretty consistent, other distant stations dependent on the weather.)  Very impressive performance for a small antenna sitting flat on top of the TV cabinet.The flat design makes this antenna easy to hide and unobtrusive.  And the external amplifier means it can be removed from the signal path if you are in an area with strong signals, or easily replaced in the future if it ever fails.THE BAD: this antenna is not designed to get low-VHF signals, such as WPVI (ABC).  But this appears to be a limitation with most indoor antennas.  In addition, the antenna is not really omnidirectional, because the signal strength does a fair amount if I rotate the unit (without moving it).One other bad thing is that the lead from the antenna to amp is fairly long piece of RG-59 and not removable.  I'd have preferred a short lead of RG-6 to minimize added noise / interference between the antenna and the amp.

A3AP82JWCGSXM3,B0042GHI8U,Philip,"[28, 29]","This is about as cheap as worthwhile lenses get.  There are only two lenses in Sony's lineup that are cheaper than this (the 50mm F1.8, and the 18-55 zoom, which I've also reviewed).  As a very low-cost lens, it gets plastic construction, the SAM (Smooth Autofocus Motor) focus system instead of screw drive or SSM (the best focus drive around), and the most basic focus markings.  The SAM focusing motor means you have to deal with two focus mode switches; one on the lens, and one on the camera.  I could live without that, really; if I had my way, this lens would just use the body-driven focus and ditch the SAM.  But putting motors in lenses is the trendy design these days.  As I said, this is an all-plastic body; it doesn't feel nearly as solid as something like a Minolta metal body prime or a Tamron 17-50.So those are the drawbacks of this lens.  Let's talk about its good points.  This is going to take a lot more space.  Remember those cheaper lenses I mentioned?  Well, the 18-55 has (or really lacks, depending on how you look at it) one feature that's rather annoying; the front element turns with the focus ring.  So if you use something like a graduated filter or polarizer, you have to focus, and then adjust that filter.  Well this ultra-low cost 35mm doesn't do that.  Turn the focus ring, and the front element stays put.  So you can set up your filter, and then move on to focusing - a much better process.  And speaking of focusing, if you're a manual transmission kind of shooter, the ring on this lens has a good long range of motion, so you can do a good job of getting just the right focus.  Good thing, too, because this lens has a very shot minimum focus distance (MFD), and when you're right up on a subject at F1.8, the depth of field is pretty darn thin, so the focus had better be spot on in a shot like that.  I like lenses with short MFD; it's nice to be able to right up to some subjects.  Back to the focus ring; it turns a bit too easily for my taste.  That's being pretty nitpicky for a lens that costs around $200, though.  So, remember the all-plastic construction?  Well, it makes this lens light as air.  If you worry about weight in your bag, you'll absolutely love this lens.  It feels good on the camera, though; I have an A700, which is about the beefiest body short of a full frame body, and it handles well with this lens in place.  The autofocus works well (with the A700 body, anyway); I've taken a couple of thousand pictures of dancers in a dark theater, and every time the focus point was set on something focusable (i.e., pretty much anything but the plain backdrop or a solid black area) the lens focused fast and accurately.  The images are sharp in the center even wide open.  Stop it down just a bit, and it's sharp all the way across.  I'd say at least F2.8 to enjoy corner to corner sharpness.  There's a bit of distortion, but not much and it's easily fixed.  And the flare control is great.  I've put the blazing sun just off center, wide open, with a slightly overexposed shot, and only gotten one tiny dot near the center of the shot.  Stop it down a bit, and even that goes away.  Very impressive.  The lens comes with a good hood (that almost doubles the apparent size of the lens), a pinch cap on the front (so it's easy to take off or put on within the hood) with a big orange alpha symbol, and your regular old rear cap, proudly telling the world that this is a Sony lens.  Well, they should be proud of it.  It's an amazing lens at this price.  Another clue that it's a great lens; I toyed around with the idea of buying one for many months, and in that time, I only saw one used copy for sale.It takes 55mm filters; this is one of the smaller sizes, so the filters cost a bit less (or a lot less, depending on the quality level you go for).This lens is a keeper.  If you've got a Sony DSLR/DST, you should have one of these.Update; I've now had this lens for over six months, and am even more convinced that this is one of the best lens values you can possibly find for a Sony DSLR.

If you've got a Sony DSLR/DST, you should have one of these.Update; I've now had this lens for over six months, and am even more convinced that this is one of the best lens values you can possibly find for a Sony DSLR.

The fun part about this camera is what when my dogs do walk around, I can follow them with the pan/tilt feature.  I can also zoom in to get a clearer idea of what they are doing.The image quality of this camera is an issue for me though.

I know it sounds cheesy but a padded and soft leather case just ""feels"" better in your hands.3.

A34DMALKZX8KXP,B004BDOGSO,"aurick ""aurick""","[4, 4]","This is without doubt the easiest case I've ever worked with.  SilverStone has definitely put a lot of thought into how to make life easier for system builders.  Some of the advantages:1) The fans are all pre-wired and come with really long cables so that you won't have any trouble connecting them to your motherboard.  There's also a panel on top of the case that has speed switches for all the included fans.  By the way, all intakes also have removable filters over them for easy cleaning.2) The 5 1/2"" drive slots have plastic covers that clamp directly to the case.  This means you can remove one from the middle and not have the others slide down.  There are also no metal plates behind them to make opening a slot a royal pain or cut your fingers.3) There's an astonishing amount of room behind the motherboard and ample holes surrounding the board.  This makes it very easy to route all your cables behind the motherboard.  In most cases, I was able to connect a cable with about a half inch of cable visible from the front of the system.  This makes cable management a dream and helps your system stay cooler.4) They included all sorts of helpful hardware.  Want to use liquid cooling?  There are brackets enclosed to attach the radiator directly to two of the 140 mm bottom fans.  Want to use an SSD?  A bracket is included for that and mounts behind the drive bays where it's out of the way.  There are also a number of very wide cable ties that slide through special slots on the back of the motherboard, helping make the easy cable management even easier.5) Since the motherboard is rotated 90 degrees (a brilliant innovation in case design that drastically improves airflow and cooling) your various wires and connectors are all going to be on top of the case.  The Raven has extra space up there, topped off with a vented cover so that you can route these wires out the back.  An improvement in the Raven 2 vs. the original Raven is that the motherboard is also actually dropped down about 2 1/2 inches from where you would expect it to be, with indentations for where the expansion slots and I/O plate go.  The end result is that you have a solid 4-5 inches to work with before the cable has to bend in order to feed out the back.  This makes the case much more compatible with the cable adapters that you might occasionally need.6) The side panels are very, very easy to remove and put back on.7) I doubt there is a power supply made that won't fit in this case.  It can accommodate way more length than my 1200 watt PSU.  The PSU can also be rotated 180 degrees.  The end result is that whether your PSU has its air intake on the top, bottom, or back end the Raven case will allow you to orient the supply so as to get the best air inflow.At the end of the day, this case provides exceptional cooling and runs very quietly.  You will get noise from your graphics cards, of course.  There's really no way around that.  But because air flowing through the system only passes one hot component before exiting the case the cards stay cooler and that means that their fans don't need to work as hard.  This results in them being quieter.I have definitely found my new favorite case.  On top of that it pairs exceptionally well with the Rampage 3 motherboard due to the fact that this board puts dual SLI graphics cards in the #1 and #3 slots rather than #1 and #2.  The extra space between those cards then means that they don't heat each other up and can really benefit from the enhanced airflow of the Raven case.Update:Now that I've finished building my system and have had the opportunity to do some benchmarking and high-end gaming I am even more impressed.  As others have noticed, the thermals for the Raven are absolutely amazing.My new system replaces one I'd had built and then returned to the manufacturer due to hardware issues.  That system had used theAntec High-End Performance Case P183 V3andASUS P6X58D Premium - LGA 1366 - X58 - DDR3 - USB 3.0 SATA 6 Gb/s - ATX Motherboardwhich I changed out on this new system with the Raven 2 case and theASUS LGA 1366 - Intel X58 - Republic of Gamers - ATX Motherboard Rampage III Extrememotherboard (which is very unusual in that it doesn't put the graphics cards right next to each other when running two-way SLI -- a very smart move.The Antec case is very well known for being a quiet machine and indeed when it was at idle it was completely silent.  The Raven is able to be heard at idle, even from a few feet away.  It's very quiet (more so than my last two computers, in fact) but you know it's running.  The story changes when you actually start gaming, though!  With the P183 case the other board my GPU's were hitting as high as 97C, making the fans speed up to 87%.  This made it a fairly loud system, easily able to be heard over my games.By comparison, the GPU's in the Raven case never got over 68C and the fans topped out at 69%.  I can't hear the system over my game at all.  (I have the fan switches all set to the ""low"" setting, by the way.  Setting them to high would undoubtedly keep the system even cooler when gaming, but it's extra noise that I don't want the rest of the time.)  So when it matters, the Raven 2 case is actually quieter than one supposedly built for quiet!SilverStone has an absolute winner with the Raven 2.  I could not be happier.

If I were (more) hard of hearing, these would frustrate me, but because I'm not and because I don't like to blast music, these headphones are great.They are lightweight enough to wear for hours, and the adjustable headpiece ensures that I get a fit that keeps them in place.

The one criticism I have of the sound quality is that it lacks the depth of more expensive sets and even the company's other Bluetooth headphones, the ARCTIC P311 Bluetooth Stereo Headphones. Despite this, the sound -- instrumental and vocal -- is clear. These are definitely more comfortable and more noise-isolating than the P311 -- as I write this, there's a vacuum running in the next room, and I can't hear it.

For this purpose, I have 3 needs: durability against high operating temperatures, quick wake up times, and quiet operation. This drive is satisfactory for all three requirements.As I learned just this month when theSSD in my basement serverfailed, SSDs can fail catastrophically. One minute, you have all your data, the next minute you have none.  Luckily, I had backed up critical files, but it was a pain rebuilding. Thus, I was somewhat interested in the durability of this SSDNow drive, obviously, I don't have time to run it for a couple years and get back to you, but I did run it for several weeks in my little HTPC, where the output fan is pushing out 70C air, and the GPU is always well over 80C. Since the datasheet for this drive lists its maximum operating temperature at 70C, I think I'm safe to say that it was running in a challenging environment, and it's still running, so pretty good there.Previously, I had been using a standard 5200 RPM laptop drive in this HTPC, and that was fine performance-wise, except that when waking from sleep it would take an annoying amount of time--perhaps 10 seconds--to fully wake up. With this solid state replacement, wake up is imperceptibly instantaneous, and I can immediately start browsing through recordings. I should point out that I don't record video streams to this disk, which has a limit on total lifetime bytes written of 36TB according to its spec sheet; recording is done on another computer onto a traditional spinning disk. Because of this lifetime limit, Linux users should tweak their settings to minimize writes to disk such as when paging memory out to the swap partition. Googling around you'll find the proper settings for your fstab file, and choosing a disk scheduler.As for quiet, well it's an SSD. It's incapable of making noise.In my particular hardware setup, which I believe has an SATA II controller, I'm getting competitive numbers on benchmarks. The IOZone benchmark (4kB records, 4GB file size) gives a peppy 181 MB/s write and 209 MB/s read throughput.So, if the drive was satisfactory on everything I threw at it, why the three stars? Mainly because, there is nothing about this particular drive that stands out from any other 128 GB SATA III drive. It doesn't excel in any particular way over competing brands I've looked at. It didn't make my boot times instantaneous (at this point booting UBuntu in 20 seconds does not knock me off my seat). If it had some extra feature, like an integrated USB interface, or was particularly low power then maybe I could have given it more than the ""It's OK"" standard of three stars.

Then you start plugging UniFi APs into your wired network.  They appear in the UniFi interface as unmanaged APs.

Instead, they ship the GoPro adapter with a nylock nut, a tiny machine screw, and a washer expecting this to be used in lieu of the GoPro thumbscrew. One can easily re-use their thumbscrew, but the Acorn nuts have to be swapped over from leftover GoPro mounts or purchased, but they are not retained in the RAM GoPro adapters! This allows the nuts to be easily lost.The rubber balls on the RAM mounts combined with the stout center assembly are the biggest selling points of the RAM mounts. It puts the other brands to shame! However, I am not a big fan of the sheet metal screws used to attach the ball assembly to the base. I could understand if it was lean manufacturing to reduce the number of specialized adapters, but almost all of the RAM mounts use the ball assembly. It would have been more secure and practical to produce an integrated ball assembly for each of the bases. That way I could still swap between mounts but bypass the need for the 2 sheet metal screws that could strip out the plastic or fail over time.I would have liked to see the ball assembly integrated into the suction cup mount. I also would have liked to see the thumbscrew included, or at least provide an acorn nut or nylock nut that is retained in the plastic GoPro adapter. This way the end user can simply reuse the GoPro thumbscrew without digging around for extra nuts. The machine screw included with the RAM mount is a smaller diameter that isn't as secure as the GoPro screw, and as a result the included nylock nut (which is too small to retain in the housing anyhow) has a smaller thread diameter that does not allow the use of the GoPro thumbscrew.

The total wattage is 1875 - more than enough for most uses and I believe that USB A is 2.1amps suiting iPad etc and USB B is 1.1 amps for droid/other smartphones. I plugged in a Galaxy s4 into B and an iPad 3 into A and both charged at standard speeds.The device itself is about 3/4&#34; thick so it sticks out a little but not that much.

They push the leading edge of lens-making in their effort to provide the ""glass"" that makes the world's greatest pictures.AF Nikkor lenses work with Nikon SLRs for optimal performance, even the very latest. The Nikon 80-200mm f2.8D ED AF is a superb 2.5x telephoto zoom for sports, portraits, and nature photography. With a fast and constant f2.8 maximum aperture through the entire focal range, ED glass elements provide high-resolution and high-contrast image even at maximum aperture. The rotating zoom ring provides precise zoom operation.ED glass: An essential element of Nikkor telephoto lensesNikon developed ED (Extra-low Dispersion) glass to enable the production of lenses that offer superior sharpness and color correction by minimizing chromatic aberration. Put simply, chromatic aberration is a type of image and color dispersion that occurs when light rays of varying wavelengths pass through optical glass. In the past, correcting this problem for telephoto lenses required special optical elements that offer anomalous dispersion characteristics--specifically calcium fluoride crystals. However, fluorite easily cracks and is sensitive to temperature changes that can adversely affect focusing by altering the lens' refractive index. So Nikon designers and engineers put their heads together and came up with ED glass, which offers all the benefits and none of the drawbacks of calcium fluorite-based glass. With this innovation, Nikon developed several types of ED glass suitable for various lenses. They deliver stunning sharpness and contrast even at their largest apertures. In this way, Nikkor's ED-series lenses exemplify Nikon's preeminence in lens innovation and performance.Nikon Super Integrated Coating ensures exceptional performanceTo enhance the performance of its optical lens elements, Nikon employs an exclusive multilayer lens coating that helps reduce ghost and flare to a negligible level. Nikon Super Integrated Coating achieves a number of objectives, including minimized reflection in the wider wavelength range and superior color balance and reproduction. Nikon Super Integrated Coating is especially effective for lenses with a large number of elements, like our Zoom-Nikkors. Also, Nikon's multilayer coating process is tailored to the design of each particular lens. The number of coatings applied to each lens element is carefully calculated to match the lens type and glass used, and also to assure the uniform color balance that characterizes Nikkor lenses. This results in lenses that meet much higher standards than the rest of the industry.Distance informationD-type and G-type Nikkors relay subject-to-camera distance information to AF Nikon camera bodies. This then makes possible advances like 3D Matrix Metering and 3D Multi-Sensor Balanced Fill-Flash. Note: D-type and G-type Nikkors provide distance information to the following cameras: Auto exposure; F6, F5, F100, F90X, F80, F75, F70, F65, F60, F55, F50, Pronea S, Pronea 600i, D2 series, D1 series, D100 and D70s/D70.

The high-zoom-ratio lens is equivalent to a focal length of 88-400mm in the 35mm format (when used on Canon EOS cameras compatible with EF-S lenses). More significantly, the image stabilizer effect creates an equivalent shutter speed of roughly four stops faster than the same size lens without an image stabilizer. In other words, if the slowest shutter speed you can hold a 250mm lens steadily is normally 1/250th of a second, this Canon lens will let you hand-hold shutter speeds as slow as 1/15th of a second. The lens also boasts a UD-glass lens element to correct chromatic aberration to create excellent image quality throughout the zoom range.

A1O229NVVDJUX2,B0075SUKIC,"Anthony Pantliano ""The Photo Guy""","[2, 2]","The Canon PowerShot D20 is a nicely done waterproof digital camera, and unless you need the extra depth rating of the D30, stick with the D20.  The new model doesn't offer a new lens, sensor, or processor, so photo quality and performance should be similar.The one thing about the D20 that stands out is that it is built like a tank.  Everything feels well put together and the buttons and doors all feel high quality.  The doors have silicone seals to keep out water, click shut tightly, and have spring-loaded releases to make sure you don't accidentally open them underwater.  The D20 is a bit larger than you might expect and has decent heft to it, but it's never a problem to carry around all day or stash in a bathing suit pocket.  The Canon feels good in the hand and all the buttons are large and easy to use.  The shutter button is a little spongy, however, and watch where you place your fingers as they are easy to get into the photo.Included with the Canon is a heavy-duty wrist strap that can be attached on the right hand side or the bottom left corner with the included snap on holder.  The problem with attaching it on the bottom left corner is that the Canon will not stand upright when the strap is attached this way.The D20 is very simple to use.  For those who want the camera to do all of the work for them there is the smart automatic mode.  It tries to figure out what you're taking a photo of to create the most pleasing result.  There are also a handful of scene modes and creative filters.  For those who want a little more control there is a program mode, a long shutter mode with options from 1"" to 15"", and custom white balance available.Performance wise the Canon is average.  It takes 1"" to focus in good light and about 2"" to focus in low light.  It turns on quickly, however, and is ready to shoot in 3"".  Continuous shooting speeds are about 1 photo every second and I took 40 photos before I stopped, but the Canon could keep going.  Moreover it only took a couple of seconds to write those photos to the memory card and be ready to shoot again.  The screen gets a little jerky when continuous shooting but it's not hard to follow your subject.  The D20's GPS works well and takes only a couple of minutes to acquire a signal.Picture quality is very good for a waterproof camera, but the Canon is let down by its 5x lens.  The lens is very slow (f/3.9 - f4.8), which means that it can't collect a lot of light, resulting in higher ISO speeds and lower photo quality.  Some cameras in this class offer an f/2.0 lens (the lower the f/ number the more light the lens can collect).  Additionally, the lens is blurry in the extreme corners and shows a bit of purple fringing and vingetting.  The lens does have an image stabilizer, however, so you can keep ISO speeds down when taking photos of static subjects, and I was able to get sharp shots at 1/4"" at wide angle.  Outside of the lens' negatives, the Canon takes nice photos.  Color, exposure, and contrast are all good.  The photos are bit soft on close inspection, but detail remains high even as ISO speeds rise.  I would recommend shooting from ISO 100-400 ideally, 800 when necessary, and 1600-3200 in emergencies.  Lastly the maximum shutter speed is only 1/1600"".Videos are recorded in full HD at 24fps with monaural sound.  I found the video quality to be high and you're able to use the optical zoom, although you will hear the motor in quiet environments.Battery life is good.  I took over 100 photos, a few videos, zoomed a lot and played with the menu and the battery only half depleted (all while the GPS was on).I used the Canon in water and didn't have any issues with leaks.  Make sure you check the seals for any debris before going underwater, and rinse the camera in mild tap water after each use underwater.  By following these simple rules you can make sure the Canon will last a long time.All in all... a nicely designed waterproof camera that deserves a better lens.06/26/2014 Update: I just came back from a cruise to Alaska where it rained a lot and the Canon D20 performed like a champ.

A2XYH8IHILWW7X,B002UAR8SK,"C. Ang ""cliff_ang""","[1, 1]","I was frustrated at first when I got the T91MT but after 1 day ended up enjoying it a lot.  In fact, I am typing this review using the T91MT.  Let's start off with what's good about it.  The T91MT works out of the box, no visible problems, the tablet works, the touchscreen works, it's easy to get used to the resistive touchscreen (which feels different from an iPhone), the battery life does seem to clock at 5 hours, very light at a little over 2 pounds, has a solid state hard drive, and (as a surprise to me) comes with a decent sleeve.After you do a little bit of tinkering, the T91MT does a pretty good job.  I've watched flash videos at decent quality (although hulu was still a little choppy).  As long as you don't expect this netbook to perform as fast as your full notebook or desktop, you should be fine.  I suggest you use Opera as your browser because it's faster than IE or Firefox and gives you the biggest viewable area.  Even with that the netbook is still noticeably slower than normal notebooks/desktops but it's not that irritating once you accept the trade-off between the portability/tablet feature/price and speed/performance.Now, here's the bad.1. The 1 GB RAM is insufficient.  I booted it with the 1 GB RAM to make sure the T91MT worked out of the box, so I had to go through the whole setup process with 1 GB of memory which seemed to take forever.  This may also have been exacerbated by the seemingly slow processor, but I think that's expected from a netbook.  This netbook definitely needs to be upgraded to 2 GB of RAM off the bat.  Changing the RAM is not too difficult (Google around first to see how it is done - as replacing notebook memory requires a slightly different method compared to desktop memory).  Once you upgrade to 2 GB RAM, there is a noticeable difference in performance.2.  The T91MT is noticeably slower in tablet mode.  However, for reading webpages (no videos) and reading e-books through Kindle, the speed in tablet mode is OK.3.  The three methods of inputting text are not great, but gets the job done.  First, the keyboard entry is sometimes difficult to handle.  In particular, when inputting passwords, you have to be very careful because some keys input twice while typing too fast may result in some keys not being hit.  Second, the handwriting recognition is pretty decent although may need a little bit of getting used to.  Third, the virtual keyboard is probably the only decent entry method, but it does take a long time to input anything.4.  Although the solid state hard drive is nice, the 32 GB of space is surely not sufficient.  I already uninstalled a lot of the bloatware and Microsoft Office and Works.  I installed Open Office instead.  Given the slow processor, I don't think this netbook would work well using Office applications.  Also, you have to install an antivirus application right away.  I just went for the Trend Micro that had an available trial pre-installed.  After all the tinkering, I ended up with only 8 GB left so I purchased a 32 GB SDHC card to expand the storage space.5.  Some of the programs/functions only worked after you tinker with the programs.  For example, Skype wouldn't log me in unless I set the connection port to 33720 under the Tools>Connections menu at the Sign In screen.  Another example is that upgrading to 2 GB of RAM, which was recognized in the BIOS immediately, did not register in the Win 7 system setting.  To get it to work, I typed MSCONFIG in the Start Menu>Search area, go to the Boot tab, then ""Advanced Options"", and change the maximum memory to manually read 2048.  Some tips on-line said to uncheck the maximum memory box, but mine was unchecked as it was.  So maybe one or the other method works.  After the computer restart, the 2 GB of RAM was read by Win 7 and the performance improvement was seen.6.  The T91MT's USB ports are on opposite sides of the computer.  Since this does not come with a DVD drive, you have to use an external one.  I already have an external ASUS DVD drive, so I didn't mind not having an optical drive on the T91MT.  However, my DVD drive requires 2 USB ports for power, but the cords a=were fairly short so I ended up buying a USB extension to make this work.  OK, this may not be the T91MT's fault, but it's something that you may want to consider.All in all, I probably spent 2 hours for setup, 6 hours tinkering with software, and spending an extra $90 for 2 GB RAM, 32 GB SDHC, and a USB extension cord.",4.0,Great Tablet/Netbook If You Are Somwehat Computer Savvy,1291420800,"12 4, 2010","I was frustrated at first when I got the T91MT but after 1 day ended up enjoying it a lot.

AC6Z7DP1Z5GHD,B00005LEOH,AWBoater,"[42, 43]","It's hard to call this lens inexpensive, unless you compare it to Nikon's 70-200mm AF-S VR2.If you are in the market for a pro telephoto lens, your basic choices are the Nikon 70-200 at over twice the price, or this lens. You can also look at 3rd party offerings by Sigma and Tamron, which are in the ballpark of this lens.When deciding on this lens, the two lenses I could afford were this one and the Sigma 70-200 f2.8. The Nikon did cost about 25% more, but recently Sigma jacked up the price of their lens - presumably because of popularity, they could do so. Now, there is only about a 15% difference in the cost of the two lenses.  The Sigma lens I was considering was the less expensive - the 70-200mm F2.8 EX DG APO Macro HSM II (non Vibration Reduction version), which was in the same ballpark of price as the Nikon.So I chose the Nikon over the Sigma for the reasons I state below. But I have to say that you could not probably go wrong with either lens, as both of them are pro caliber.First, this lens is AF, not AF-S, which means if you have a D40, D3100, or D5100, you won't be able to auto-focus it.This is Nikon's current production version of this lens, and is superior I think to the older versions (with the possible exception of the short-lived AF-S version).  It is still made by Nikon, probably because of the high cost of their flagship 70-200. The lens is an older design, so it doesn't have VR (Vibration Reduction) or AF-S (in-lens motor).Consequently the focusing system is slower, but I believe it has been unfairly criticized as so. Perhaps it's closes competitor is Sigma's 70-200 f2.8, which has an internal lens focus motor, so it will work with the less expensive Nikon cameras, while this one will not.Other criticism has been that many of today's cameras that have focus motors do not have focus motors strong enough to rapidly focus this lens, especially the advanced amateur cameras such as the D90, D7000, etc.Nikon has made several versions of this lens over the years. The earlier lenses, known as ""push-pull"", zoomed by pulling the lens out, or pushing it in. Those lenses were known to have notoriously slow auto focusing, and perhaps much of the criticism of this lenses focusing speed may be due to those models.In later years, Nikon changed from a push-pull model to a rotating ring to change the zoom. These are known as ""two ring"" models. Nikon also improved the focus speed of these lenses.  The current offering from Nikon - and the one I have - is the two-ring model.Before I purchased this lens, I reviewed several YouTube videos that performed ""focus tests"" on several different models of the Nikon 80-200 f2.8 as well as the Sigma 70-200 f2.8. The focus test consisted of leaving the lens cap on, then depressing the shutter release 1/2 way, which forces the lens to cycle the focus range, from stop-to-stop.I also tried this on my lens as soon as UPS dropped it off. I am using a Nikon D90, and using a stopwatch, I tested the lens focus speed, and since I don't have any of the other lenses, I timed the several YouTube videos showing different lens/camera combinations.  Here are the results:1. My D90 with the Nikon 80-200 lens: 1.1 seconds.2. YouTube D90 with Nikon 80-200 (two ring zoom):  1.0~1.1 seconds.3. YouTube D90 with old Nikon 80-200 (push pull zoom): 1.6 seconds.4. YouTube D300 with old Nikon 80-200 (push pull zoom): 3.4 seconds.5. YouTube D90 with current model Sigma 70-200: 1.4 seconds.And for comparison...YouTube (unknown camera) with Nikon 70-200 VR1: 0.6 seconds.The results were enough to convince me that there is not a focus speed problem, especially compared with the Sigma 70-200 (even though the Sigma lens has it's own focus motor).Another surprise is that while different cameras focused the same lens at different speeds, the D90 was actually faster than the more expensive D300. However, I'll caveat that in test 3, I could not absolutely verify that the lens was truly a push-pull model. The focus speed does suggest it might be the later two-ring model.And just for comparison sake, I also looked at the more expensive AF-S Nikon VR1 (which is not the current model). I could not find a test on YouTube for the VR2, but I would expect it to be as fast as the VR1 or faster.While the Nikon 80-200 is slower than the newest Nikon models, that is to be expected. And my choice was between the Nikon 80-200 vs. the Sigma 70-200, and for those two lenses, the Nikon certainly holds it's own.I also believe Nikon's optics to be better than the Sigma's, along with brand recognition and resale.  Since the current model has been in production for 13 years, considering a used lens could be any one of those year models. And the resale for these lenses in excellent condition averaged about 75% of a new one, I'd say the lens holds it's resale very well.In contrast, the Sigma lost value more rapidly, and while I did not find a lot of used ones, the resale was already about 60%-70% of a new one. Not a big difference between the two brands, but considering the Sigma version is a lot newer, it's resale value may not likely hold up as well as it ages. Resale value in itself is not necessarily an indicator of the quality of the lens, and probably has as much to do with brand recognition.One thing that kept nagging at me is that I intend this to be the final purchase for this type of lens. Many of the folks that used the Sigma have made the comment that the lens gets you started in the pro area, and when you go to resell it, you will get your money out of the lens when it is time to upgrade.I suppose the same could be said for the Nikon, but I don't plan on having to upgrade in the future, as at this point, as an amateur photographer, while VR and AF-S are nice, it's not in the budget to pay double the price for a lens with those features.One other pesky issue I found with used Nikons is that the Manual/Auto switch tends to break. A lot of older lenses had this problem. It is plastic for some reason, and seems to be a weak point.  Whether or not this holds true for current production I'll have to wait to find out, but the lens does have a 5 year warranty.Other factors.The Sigma lens is known as a Macro lens, with a minimum-focus distance of 3.3ft, and a weight of 48.3 oz. and a length 7.25"" and a dia of 3.3"" dia.In comparison, I was surprised that the Nikon also has a Macro function, but it must be put into manual focus mode to do so (which is not untypical of a Macro lens). For the Nikon, the normal minimum-focus distance is 5.9ft, with a Macro distance of 4.9ft. The weight of the Nikon is 45.8 oz, and a length 7.3"" and a dia of 3.4"" dia.Neither of the lenses has a large advantage over the other in this regard.So it all comes down to use. The Nikon lens is known be very sharp, and to have creamy-smooth bokeh, and it surely lived up to those superlatives in my initial use. I am very pleased with this purchase. In contrast, the Sigma has been well reported to be a bit soft at the longer focal lengths. But like anyone else, this is scuttlebutt, and how much it has to do with the truth I cannot say as I don't have that lens.Another issue with the D90 and the Nikon lens is that there is a known limitation that if the lens is used at the minimum 80mm, and used at the minimum 5.9ft focus distance, the camera may think the lens is in focus, when it is not (it's in the D90 manual). In those situations, you can always go into manual/macro mode to focus the lens.However, I have not experienced the mis-focusing. Not to say it won't happen, but so far, I have not had the occasion to see it.  At any rate, this is an event that is not likely to occur much, given my photo habits. I guess this is what makes this a great, but not perfect lens.One thing I found, especially with shooting telephoto at f2.8, that you have to re-learn how to focus the camera, and quite possibly to manually select your focus point. If the lens is not focusing on your intended subject, at F2.8, you may very well get an out of focus photo. But this is characteristic with all of the lenses of this type.In conclusion, when comparing the Sigma and Nikon lenses, if you have a D70 or better (camera body with internal focusing motor), you will love this lens. If you have an entry-level Nikon (D3100, D5100, etc), the Sigma is probably going to be your choice, unless you want to spend 4 times as much for the Nikon 70-200 lens as your camera cost.Besides, my son has a D3000, and he won't be able to borrow my lens.",5.0,Oh my gosh... a wonderful lens.,1305158400,"05 12, 2011","It's hard to call this lens inexpensive, unless you compare it to Nikon's 70-200mm AF-S VR2.If you are in the market for a pro telephoto lens, your basic choices are the Nikon 70-200 at over twice the price, or this lens.

A lot of older lenses had this problem. It is plastic for some reason, and seems to be a weak point. Whether or not this holds true for current production I'll have to wait to find out, but the lens does have a 5 year warranty.Other factors.The Sigma lens is known as a Macro lens, with a minimum-focus distance of 3.3ft, and a weight of 48.3 oz. and a length 7.25"" and a dia of 3.3"" dia.In comparison, I was surprised that the Nikon also has a Macro function, but it must be put into manual focus mode to do so (which is not untypical of a Macro lens). For the Nikon, the normal minimum-focus distance is 5.9ft, with a Macro distance of 4.9ft. The weight of the Nikon is 45.8 oz, and a length 7.3"" and a dia of 3.4"" dia.Neither of the lenses has a large advantage over the other in this regard.So it all comes down to use. The Nikon lens is known be very sharp, and to have creamy-smooth bokeh, and it surely lived up to those superlatives in my initial use. I am very pleased with this purchase. In contrast, the Sigma has been well reported to be a bit soft at the longer focal lengths. But like anyone else, this is scuttlebutt, and how much it has to do with the truth I cannot say as I don't have that lens.Another issue with the D90 and the Nikon lens is that there is a known limitation that if the lens is used at the minimum 80mm, and used at the minimum 5.9ft focus distance, the camera may think the lens is in focus, when it is not (it's in the D90 manual). In those situations, you can always go into manual/macro mode to focus the lens.However, I have not experienced the mis-focusing. Not to say it won't happen, but so far, I have not had the occasion to see it. At any rate, this is an event that is not likely to occur much, given my photo habits. I guess this is what makes this a great, but not perfect lens.One thing I found, especially with shooting telephoto at f2.8, that you have to re-learn how to focus the camera, and quite possibly to manually select your focus point. If the lens is not focusing on your intended subject, at F2.8, you may very well get an out of focus photo. But this is characteristic with all of the lenses of this type.In conclusion, when comparing the Sigma and Nikon lenses, if you have a D70 or better (camera body with internal focusing motor), you will love this lens. If you have an entry-level Nikon (D3100, D5100, etc), the Sigma is probably going to be your choice, unless you want to spend 4 times as much for the Nikon 70-200 lens as your camera cost.Besides, my son has a D3000, and he won't be able to borrow my lens.",Oh my gosh... a wonderful lens.,2011-05-12,Nikon 80-200mm f/2.8D ED AF Zoom Nikkor Lens for Nikon Digital SLR Cameras,"Lens-making is an art--Nikon artisans craft Nikkor optics from the finest materials, taking pride in adding their intellect and technique to bring the world's finest lenses to life. They push the leading edge of lens-making in their effort to provide the ""glass"" that makes the world's greatest pictures.AF Nikkor lenses work with Nikon SLRs for optimal performance, even the very latest. The Nikon 80-200mm f2.8D ED AF is a superb 2.5x telephoto zoom for sports, portraits, and nature photography. With a fast and constant f2.8 maximum aperture through the entire focal range, ED glass elements provide high-resolution and high-contrast image even at maximum aperture. The rotating zoom ring provides precise zoom operation.ED glass: An essential element of Nikkor telephoto lensesNikon developed ED (Extra-low Dispersion) glass to enable the production of lenses that offer superior sharpness and color correction by minimizing chromatic aberration. Put simply, chromatic aberration is a type of image and color dispersion that occurs when light rays of varying wavelengths pass through optical glass. In the past, correcting this problem for telephoto lenses required special optical elements that offer anomalous dispersion characteristics--specifically calcium fluoride crystals. However, fluorite easily cracks and is sensitive to temperature changes that can adversely affect focusing by altering the lens' refractive index. So Nikon designers and engineers put their heads together and came up with ED glass, which offers all the benefits and none of the drawbacks of calcium fluorite-based glass. With this innovation, Nikon developed several types of ED glass suitable for various lenses. They deliver stunning sharpness and contrast even at their largest apertures. In this way, Nikkor's ED-series lenses exemplify Nikon's preeminence in lens innovation and performance.Nikon Super Integrated Coating ensures exceptional performanceTo enhance the performance of its optical lens elements, Nikon employs an exclusive multilayer lens coating that helps reduce ghost and flare to a negligible level. Nikon Super Integrated Coating achieves a number of objectives, including minimized reflection in the wider wavelength range and superior color balance and reproduction. Nikon Super Integrated Coating is especially effective for lenses with a large number of elements, like our Zoom-Nikkors. Also, Nikon's multilayer coating process is tailored to the design of each particular lens. The number of coatings applied to each lens element is carefully calculated to match the lens type and glass used, and also to assure the uniform color balance that characterizes Nikkor lenses. This results in lenses that meet much higher standards than the rest of the industry.Distance informationD-type and G-type Nikkors relay subject-to-camera distance information to AF Nikon camera bodies. This then makes possible advances like 3D Matrix Metering and 3D Multi-Sensor Balanced Fill-Flash. Note: D-type and G-type Nikkors provide distance information to the following cameras: Auto exposure; F6, F5, F100, F90X, F80, F75, F70, F65, F60, F55, F50, Pronea S, Pronea 600i, D2 series, D1 series, D100 and D70s/D70.

If you have an Android smartphone, for example, you probably already have a cable.- Modular design. The drive comes apart easily (no tools). The thin bar has the USB 3.0-ish inputs on one edge, and standard laptop SATA on the other side. I'm guessing that you could use the top bar of this as a SATA dock for other laptop drives. Haven't tested it yet but love the modular design.- Comes with a cable. Ready to use out of the box.- Mac integration. HFS+ filesystem supports the Timemachine backup software built in to OS X. This is a great feature. If you delete your files you can ""go back in time"" (via the magic of filesystem snapshots) and pull the files from an old version of your data set.Dislikes:- None so far. Reliable with good performance.Caveats:- This drive is formated HFS+, which is Apple OS X (Mac) filesystem. This is probably what you want if you use mostly Macs.If you want a drive you can use with both Windows and OS X, you have two main options:1. Use HFS+. This drive comes like this out of the box. This works better with Macs, but to use the drive on a PC you need to install a driver (included). I haven't tested this feature yet.2. Use NTFS. Either reformat this drive from windows (will erase all data on it), or buy the PC version of this drive. This works great from Windows.

Weighing in at just over 2.5 ounces, the Garmin Forerunner 305 breaks new ground in terms of comfort, style, and performance. Totally redesigned, the 305 gives outdoor athletes and runners real-time information about speed, distance, pace, and heart rate on a device that's easy to use and amazingly compact.The Forerunner 305 features the powerful new SiRF GPS navigation chip for supreme accuracy, even under tree cover and between tall buildings. A coded chest strap heart-rate monitor prevents unwanted interference from other devices.View larger.The unit's GPS receiver is designed to face towards the sky when you're running.A more watch-like design makes it far easier to use and wear.Plus, the 305 is engineered to help folks train better and smarter. Training assistant tools, various distance and time alerts, and bundled Training Center PC software combine to make the device an essential part of any athlete's training program.The 305's digitally coded heart-rate monitor--which is worn as a chest strap--sends heart-rate data to the device so you can see whether you're training too hard or not hard enough. Alerts for pace, distance, time, and heart rate are also available. Additionally, the unit tracks speed, distance, pace, and calories burned. Meanwhile, a course feature lets you race against previous runs in order to improve your time or just compare heart rate and pace data at every point of the way.The 305's easy-to-read, 1.3-inch display has been integrated into a sleek and stylish form factor that is definitely a step up from the larger and more cumbersome Forerunner 301 model. Indeed, the 305 looks and wears like a stylish sports watch, and it's more carefully designed to meet the needs of athletes. The design also positions the antenna with an optimal view of the sky. As an added feature, the case is water resistant to IEC 60529 IPX7 standards (can be submerged in one meter of water for 30 minutes).Accuracy is the name of the game with the 305. The vastly more accurate GPS antenna and receiver, which uses an advanced SiRF chip, offer much faster satellite acquisition times. Plus, the unit can hold a fix in places never before possible. Gone are the days of losing a fix under tree cover or when running between tall buildings. All of these features add up to far more accuracy in recording and tracking your exercise data. And because the 305 uses GPS to track how far and how fast you're going, you never have to calibrate it. The unit also doubles as a basic navigator. Mark your starting point as a specific location, see your current position on the plotter display, and follow an electronic breadcrumb trail back to your starting point.The 305 features a USB data connection and docking cradle for downloading your speed, lap, exercise time, and heart-rate data into Garmin's Training Center PC software. The unit stores up to 1,000 lap histories, which you can download to your PC for a detailed post-workout analysis. Plus, you can create and schedule workouts using the included software and download them to the unit. A rechargeable internal lithium-ion battery offers up to ten hours of battery life.For additional post-workout analysis, the 305 is compatible with MotionBased software. MotionBased adds a new dimension to training and outdoor fitness that makes the analytical aspects of a sport more compelling and a lot more fun. You can upload data to MotionBased, a Web-based application that has partnered with Garmin. MotionBased provides in-depth analysis of your workouts, as well as online mapping and route sharing that will take your training to the next level. MotionBased automatically calculates time, distance, speed, elevation, and heart rate, and it displays this information through meaningful charts, illustrations, reports, and maps. With MotionBased, you can also race multiple instances of the same route to see how you are improving or to race other members of MotionBased. You can ""virtually race"" someone you don't even know.If you like the features of the Forerunner 305 but don't need heart-rate monitoring, be sure to check out theForerunner 205.What's in the BoxForerunner 305 unit, digital coded heart rate monitor, Training Center CD-ROM, A/C charger, PC/USB interface cable, owner's manual, and quick-start guide.",281.3,Garmin,GPS & Navigation,Sports & Handheld GPS,Amazon,2011,1,3,4033,0.7592243975903614,0,0,0.0,258,0.008470930809701863,1.4063531981072763,3.5,2.1213203435596424,2,2,4.222222222222222,1.3397282541141673,27,27,"Garmin Forerunner 305 GPS Receiver With Heart Rate Monitor (Discontinued by Manufacturer) Amazon.com Product Description The successor to the Garmin Forerunner 301 is here, and it's better than ever.

A coded chest strap heart-rate monitor prevents unwanted interference from other devices.View larger.The unit's GPS receiver is designed to face towards the sky when you're running.A more watch-like design makes it far easier to use and wear.Plus, the 305 is engineered to help folks train better and smarter. Training assistant tools, various distance and time alerts, and bundled Training Center PC software combine to make the device an essential part of any athlete's training program.The 305's digitally coded heart-rate monitor--which is worn as a chest strap--sends heart-rate data to the device so you can see whether you're training too hard or not hard enough. Alerts for pace, distance, time, and heart rate are also available. Additionally, the unit tracks speed, distance, pace, and calories burned. Meanwhile, a course feature lets you race against previous runs in order to improve your time or just compare heart rate and pace data at every point of the way.The 305's easy-to-read, 1.3-inch display has been integrated into a sleek and stylish form factor that is definitely a step up from the larger and more cumbersome Forerunner 301 model. Indeed, the 305 looks and wears like a stylish sports watch, and it's more carefully designed to meet the needs of athletes. The design also positions the antenna with an optimal view of the sky. As an added feature, the case is water resistant to IEC 60529 IPX7 standards (can be submerged in one meter of water for 30 minutes).Accuracy is the name of the game with the 305. The vastly more accurate GPS antenna and receiver, which uses an advanced SiRF chip, offer much faster satellite acquisition times. Plus, the unit can hold a fix in places never before possible. Gone are the days of losing a fix under tree cover or when running between tall buildings. All of these features add up to far more accuracy in recording and tracking your exercise data. And because the 305 uses GPS to track how far and how fast you're going, you never have to calibrate it. The unit also doubles as a basic navigator. Mark your starting point as a specific location, see your current position on the plotter display, and follow an electronic breadcrumb trail back to your starting point.The 305 features a USB data connection and docking cradle for downloading your speed, lap, exercise time, and heart-rate data into Garmin's Training Center PC software. The unit stores up to 1,000 lap histories, which you can download to your PC for a detailed post-workout analysis. Plus, you can create and schedule workouts using the included software and download them to the unit. A rechargeable internal lithium-ion battery offers up to ten hours of battery life.For additional post-workout analysis, the 305 is compatible with MotionBased software. MotionBased adds a new dimension to training and outdoor fitness that makes the analytical aspects of a sport more compelling and a lot more fun. You can upload data to MotionBased, a Web-based application that has partnered with Garmin. MotionBased provides in-depth analysis of your workouts, as well as online mapping and route sharing that will take your training to the next level. MotionBased automatically calculates time, distance, speed, elevation, and heart rate, and it displays this information through meaningful charts, illustrations, reports, and maps. With MotionBased, you can also race multiple instances of the same route to see how you are improving or to race other members of MotionBased. You can ""virtually race"" someone you don't even know.If you like the features of the Forerunner 305 but don't need heart-rate monitoring, be sure to check out theForerunner 205.What's in the BoxForerunner 305 unit, digital coded heart rate monitor, Training Center CD-ROM, A/C charger, PC/USB interface cable, owner's manual, and quick-start guide.",1831,635

I have had this dock for a few weeks now and set it up in the kitchen. I was hoping to listen to music while cleaning and cooking. I really wanted to love this dock but I don't. First, if you want to plug it in and have it against the wall, not possible, the cord sticks out straight from the back so it will not push up against the wall. Also, this is one of the biggest docking devices I have seen. It is not pleasing to the eyes and looks like something that came from the 80's. The green LED display look outdated and with the design, it is not pleasing.I will say the radio, FM sounds great. I don't listen to the radio much but was pleased with the FM sound and clarity to it. Now in comes my Acer. If you are looking to dock any Android device, it is possible. The dock itself, or plug, moves left and right and the plug turns around in case it is backwards for your device. It will accommodate all devices. However, when plugging in my Acer tablet, I cannot tell you how many times I scratched it trying to line the darn thing up. With it sliding left to right, front to back, and trying to plug it in without being able to see it (the bottom of the device), it is poorly designed. Another poorly designed feature, if you are using the dock, be sure your device is small. The speakers are on the front, right where the device is docked! Being a tablet it takes up over 60% of the speaker area and sounds so tinny! I have $10 speakers that sound better. Also, when it sits on the dock, it sits at an angle. I fear my Acer is going to fall it is tilting so badly. The only advantage of having it on the dock is it does charge the device but considering how much it scratches it and also covers the speakers, it is not worth being charged.I know it states to download the Fidelio software and Songbird. I did not think I needed it but you need the software in order for the Bluetooth to work, another bad idea. Once you get the software you have to go into the settings and then pair the Bluetooth. I liked this feature a lot better and will admit the sound, obviously without having most of the speaker covered, sounded better. Sadly, it is not being charged though.Compared to all the other iPod devices I have, this one is so poorly designed.

Guess I could try to solution used by another reviewer, using a cable from the headphone jack on the phone to the audio in jack on the Micro Hi-Fi, but I have pretty well already decided the CD skipping is a deal-breaker.)It's pretty big - I had imagined the player being about 12"" by 8"" or 10"" or so, but it's the size of a full-sized ""boom box."" I think I could have lived with this, since the sound is so good, had I not had these other problems.What a bummer - I have other consumer Philips products I've been quite happy with. This particular model appears not to have the bugs all worked out, or possibly I just got a defective unit. Too bad, but I'm going to have to return this.","Sounds great but CD player skips.

A2NB2E5DXE319Z,B004YI9NTS,S. Lionel,"[9, 12]","Pros:+ Includes remote control+ Uses DLNA for local network playback+ Built-in weather app+ USB inputCons:- Controls often unresponsive- No WiFi Protected Setup- Won't play Apple Lossless .m4a filesThe Grace Digital ""Mondo"" is clearly an attempt to copy the popularLogitech Squeezebox Radio. The two products are very similar in size, shape and configuration, right down to the handle recess in the back. The Mondo is an inch taller and wider than the Squeezebox Radio, but close enough.  Both have a color LCD screen, large rubberized knob that pushes in for selection and buttons for favorite stations.There are some physical differences: the Mondo has a separate volume control knob that sticks out the top, which when pushed mutes the audio, whereas the Logitech has its volume/mute knob on the front. The Mondo also has a snooze/sleep-timer button on top for the alarm function - while the Logitech can also serve as an alarm clock, it has no dedicated snooze button.There are some differences in the Mondo's favor. A significant one is that, unlike the Squeezebox, it can play from any DLNA server on your network without the need to run a dedicated server program. I keep my music on aNETGEAR ReadyNAS Ultra 4 Plus Network Attached Storage Boxand it operates as a DLNA server.  However, a Squeezebox Server program is also available for it so this advantage is muted for me.  (And no, I didn't mean ""mooted"", though I suppose that also applies.) However, if you don't have a DLNA server on your network, you'll need to run one. There are many free servers available for various platforms. Recent versions of Windows Media Player have this capability.Unfortunately for me, the Mondo will not play Apple Lossless high-bitrate .m4a files.  It sees them, but when you ask it to play they are just skipped over.  This is not just a DLNA issue as the Mondo won't play them from a USB stick either.  The Squeezebox Radio will play them, however. Luckily I don't have a lot of those, but I have been choosing that format for ripping CDs recently and that shuts them out of playback on the Mondo. [After my initial review was posted, Grace Digital said that they would add Apple Lossless support in the future.]Another annoyance is the method of entering the wireless network password.  The Logitech Squeezebox Radio supports Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS), where you push a button on your router (and select an option on the Radio) and the wireless information is exchanged automatically.  The Mondo makes you enter the password manually by scrolling through the characters one by one.Both products share a wealth of features.  Of course they'll both play Internet Radio and have searchable and categorized lists of stations. Both can identify ""local"" stations with streaming broadcasts. Both can access a variety of services such as Pandora, SiriusXM, last.fm and many more.  Both can serve as clock-radios, have adjustable dimmable displays and both support WiFi connectivity.  The Mondo will also support wired Ethernet if you buy an optional USB adapter, but the Squeezebox Radio has an Ethernet jack built in.  Both let you do some customization on a web site and both offer smartphone apps that can control a box on your local network.The Mondo includes an infrared remote control; Logitech makes you buy that separately. The Mondo also comes with a stereo line-out cord for connecting to a hi-fi system - the Squeezebox Radio does not have line out capability.  Both include a 1/8"" stereo phone jack for connecting an iPod or other music player. You can get an optional rechargeable battery for the Squeezebox Radio - the Mondo has a compartment for one (at least that's what I think it is) on the underside, but Grace Digital doesn't list one for sale that I can see and there is no mention in the manual. (Edit: Grace Digital informs me that a battery is now available.)So what is the Mondo like to use?  Frustrating.  The first unit I received played fine - for about 15 seconds.  Then it went mute.  A power cycle brought it back for another 15 seconds, but after that nothing I did could get it to play.  I sent it back to Grace Digital (at my expense) and they promptly replaced it. I do commend Grace Digital's tech support - they were very communicative and one rep told me she had my replacement unit playing for an hour on her desk just to make sure it worked.The Mondo's controls feel ""cheap"" compared to those of the Squeezebox Radio, and the buttons sometimes are unresponsive.  For example, to set a station memory you push and hold one of the memory buttons. (The Mondo has 10 memory positions with a ""shift"", the Squeezebox Radio has 6.)  The manual says that you will see an indication on the screen that the station was saved, but, except for a brief flash once, I don't get this.  It did save the station, however.  There is a single button that serves as pause and play, but often it is ignored and the music just keeps playing.  There's a button with the square ""stop"" icon on it, but when playing a stream, it just gives an error message.  The sound quality isn't bad, but the Logitech's is noticeably better, with more bass and better ""presence"".If I didn't have a Logitech Squeezebox Radio to compare it to, I'd perhaps think better of the Grace Digital Mondo.  It is by no means a bad product, but it is mediocre, hampered further by firmware glitches (which might get ironed out - both products have the ability to auto-update over the Internet.)  But as it is, I find the Mondo a poor runner-up to the Squeezebox Radio. If you account for having to buy a remote control for the Logitech (if you want one, that is), the two products cost about the same.

I found the enclosed instructions difficult to understand, but was able to find a PDF file on-line with clearer and more complete instructions, and those instructions were very helpful.With the instructions in hand, programming is relatively straight forward, although not intuitive. I needed to manually enter many blocked numbers because I had them documented from when I had &#34;selective call blocking&#34; from Cox - a service I am now able to cancel and save a monthly fee!In order to program in these numbers, it's necessary to have a phone hooked up directly to the Blocker and the Blocker hooked up to a live phone line.The only issue with this is that to get into the programming mode, you must be attached to a live phone line and the dial tone - which means that in the process of programming, you are actually dialing numbers! This could result in inadvertently calling numbers you don't want to call. This is an annoyance, but not a show-stopper.If you have answered (picked up) a call and determined you don't want to hear from that number again, it's easy to just push one button on the Blocker to add that number to the blocked list. But like most people, I have many phones in the house, and the chances that I am at the phone with the Blocker attached is very small. No worries. After hanging up from the undesired call, you just use the left-right buttons on the Blocker to call up the Caller ID of the offending call, then press the BLOCK button.I also followed the instructions to automatically block all &#34;out of area&#34; or PRIVATE or UNKNOWN incoming calls.I've now seen the product successfully block several &#34;out of area&#34; calls; the phone rings once (during the initial period it takes to send through the Caller ID), and then the call is blocked - no more rings.It's also possible to program blocking all calls from certain area codes. For example, lots of political calls come from Washington, DC, so you could block all area code 202 incoming calls. Of course then you'd miss that important follow-up contact from the President! I haven't used this feature, but based on the unit's performance, I trust it works.It also can block outgoing calls. Having only two relatively mature adults in my house, this is a solution in search of a problem, but if you had kids this might be a feature.Removing blocked numbers is quite easy (with the downloaded instructions).I believe the folks who gave this unfavorable ratings fall into one of three categories:1) They might be on a phone provider not compatible with this device. I didn't have that problem, so it wasn't an issue for me.2) They might have gotten frustrated trying to program the device. Even though I consider myself reasonably tech-savvy, the programming wasn't a no-brainer, and I understand that many people would have given up in frustration.3) They may have received a defective device. This is cheaply made, mass-produced item and I wouldn't be at all surprised if many people did actually receive defective units. I was lucky and got a good one.But if you receive a working unit, if it works with your phone provider, and if you have the patience to program it, it does what it promises.So in short -+ It works!- It's a bit kluge-y to programOverall, this is a big hit in my household, and as an added bonus it is saving us the former monthly &#34;selective call blocking&#34; fee I used to pay to Cox, my internet and phone service provider.",4.0,"So far, it works great, but non-intuitive interface makes it a tad unfriendly to program",1391644800,"02 6, 2014","This product arrived quickly.

It's hard...","[0, 1]","Disclosure: I was contacted by Brainwavz and asked if I would like to receive a product in exchange for a review.  They decided on the product; I promised a fair and honest review in exchange.First of all, is it supposed to come across as ""brain waves?""  I think that's what they're after, but phonetically it's incorrect, the pronunciation actually ""brain wavs.""  Sorry, that's just the niggling editor and linguist in me.In the box: a small hard case in a snappy red and black and inside the ear buds, an airline adapter (nice), a small bag with 7 additional pairs of differently sized earphone tips (silicone, bi-flange, tri-flange, etc.), and a separate baggie of one pair of Comply(tm) ""premium"" isolation memory foam tips.Out of the box it's a nice picture, the full set in the case.  The hard case is nice, and holds everything well, with two elastic inside pockets for storage of extra gear.  And it's even got a double zipper, so you can zip north or south, up or down, whatever zippin' direction you choose, even both at once!The memory foam tips are like squishablefoam earplugs; you squish them down and insert them in your ear canal, and their slow expansion fits them snugly into place while blocking outside noise.  This is a good concept but in my experience in testing these with the earbuds, it didn't work too well, at first.  The foam squishes down just fine, but by the time you've got left and right figured out, the earbud oriented correctly, the cord snaked up and over your ear with the bud aimed right for a correct fit, the bud tip is already foamed back out, which kind of defeats the intent of getting it in while it's squished down.  And you start over.  I'll admit that after a few awkward tries I got the fit pretty much right, and I did detect a significant lessening of external sound with these memory foam bud tips in use.  No, they did not block all sound, not even close, but compared to the rubber/silicone tips they block much more outside sound.The cord, coming in at 1.3m (51.2"") is an interesting flat design, much like wide fettuccine.  It's got a wide split for the buds, plenty of room to get around your face and head, with a little slider that can tighten it up for you if snug is what you're after.I do have one niggling observation: the L/R indicators.  Usually you find the ""L"" on that one end, and you're all set.  It took me some dedicated inspection to detect that ""L,"" a tiny, and I do mean really teeny-tiny little mark in the molded plastic of the earbud frame (check it out in the main product image).  And it's not in a contrasting color; it's the same color as the plastic it's molded into.  I recommend a slight change to make it easier to find that ""L.""The earbuds themselves feel good, a good metal feel in your hand, not some feather-light plastic.  The feel hefty, which implies quality.Performance: I own a pair of Sennheiser HD 570s, so I'm into headphone sound.  And these were impressive from the outset.  Excellent sound reproduction across the entire spectrum.  The box promises ""rich details,"" and I agree fully.  They promise ""deep bass,"" and I also concur.  I thought the bass response was particularly good, with good bottom-end thrum and pop, but not overshadowing the mids and high end.  Treble response is also excellent, with all manner of traditional and modern jazz coming through beautifully, brushwork very clear and distinct.  The Talking Heads' original ""Born Under Punches"" was a test song, and was absolutely delightful.Sound separation was very good, with the sound visually centered inside my head, not one side or the other.Safety note: with all earbud tips in I was more than able to hear my surroundings, even with the buds at very high volume.  While it's never a good idea to ride or bike or run with buds or phones in, these do allow the outside to come in, somewhat.I note that for this sound to come through these have to be properly fitted and snug in your ears.

A9ELHLPXF7JKD,B00BWHILCY,A. D. Lum,"[219, 225]","Oh my goodness, I love this thing! I've used three different regular cases, a mini bluetooth keyboard, and a keyboard/case combo. I did not expect this to be vastly different from the other keyboard case that I tried.First of all, this is a hard case. It does not flex. The other keyboard case that I tried was rigid/stiff, but it could flex a tiny bit. That means that when closed, part of the keyboard could make contact with the iPad screen. Maybe that's nothing, but I don't like anything that isn't soft touching the iPad's screen. This case was built with close tolerances. When closed, the keyboard comes very close to the screen, but does not touch it. If you hold it up to the light, you can see the tiny separation. If you don't believe your eyes, you will find that you can slide a sheet of paper between the keyboard and iPad when the case is closed.The bluetooth syncing/linking was easy. Also, there is no physical switch to turn the keyboard off and on like there was on my other keyboard case. The keypad is engaged when the keyboard is in one of its three possible reclining positions. The case magnetically ""snaps"" into one of the three reclining positions. Snap it out and bluetooth goes off. No more worrying that you forgot to turn off the bluetooth switch.There are two trade-offs. A trade-off is not a flaw. It is a feature whose existence means that something else is necessarily lost or diminished. For some, trade-offs are good, and for others not so good. For me, both trade-offs are good.Trade-off #1: The sound deflector over the speakers directs sound toward the user. It amplifies it a little and also makes it quieter for those who are not in front of the device. A larger deflector (including your own cupped palm) does the job better, but then it would look ugly and get in the way. I prefer a deflector that does a moderate job but is unobtrusive and looks good. That's better than one that works great but looks like a bullhorn stuck on your case.Trade-off #2: The case is not hinged. That means it does not open predictably like a book. The two portions of this case are ""tethered"" together by a strong, wide, and thin material. This makes it easier for butterfingers to fumble with, but it allows the case to do something that a hinged case cannot do. You can flip the keyboard section in back of the iPad section with the keys facing away from you or toward you. In this configuration, the sections are ""stacked"". It's like folding a magazine so that the rest of the magazine is behind the page you are reading. But a magazine is hinged. The part folded back is always facing away from you. Another way to say it is that you can flip the keyboard directly behind and parallel to the iPad, with the keys facing away from or toward the iPad. I much prefer the keys to be facing toward the iPad. That way, my fingers are contacting the smooth outer case instead of the keys on the keyboard. Bravo. I like this tethering feature, even if it does require one to be a little more careful.How about the feel of the keyboard? No complaints.Scratching? I tend to treat my electronic stuff with care. But I'm not a fanatic about it. I do a normal amount of sliding it around (metal side down) on tables and such. There is no scratching that I can see.While in the library using my iPad to do word processing with Pages 09, I felt like taking a break and browsing a bit. I wondered if I could stand it up in portrait orientation. I expected it to utterly fail as it was not designed to do this. But much to my delight, it can stand up on its side. Sure, it stands vertically (can't tilt the screen), but I tend to slink down in my chair when I relax so it was no problem!Finally, this case looks good. It looks cool. It's slimmer than even the non-keyboard cases I've used. The smooth finish and the perfect way it mates up with the iPad is something to admire. I have an urge to show it off.

A21519P9B7ACHJ,B004J4VYG2,"John ""alphajc""","[13, 14]","Update as of 3/30/2013The device has been malfunctioning with it being very difficult to catch a GPS signal.  In doing a recent update for the latest the maps, the device ""bricked"" and has been rendered useless.  I have been unable to load the maps and the existing maps were lost.  Now as the device is out of warranty, TomTom is unable to help.  I am working with Visa (since it was purchased with the Amazon card and warranties are extended by 1 year) for a possible repair or replacement.  I did initially like this device due to the high end features you get for the low price, but its unreliability and now breakdown makes it a device that should not be bought.Update as of 8/12/2011There has been a couple of software updates for this device which makes the device more reliable...I do now notice that bluetooth calling clarity has improved a bit, directions with traffic is calculated faster and lastly voice recognition has greatly improved.  It was unfortunate that TomTom initially released a buggy device, but they are fixing it, so the first thing that everyone should do with this device after getting it, is to update the software.The TomTom Via series of GPS Navigators replace an aging line of TomTom One derived models.  The Via adopts the ""new look"" maps and interface as adopted from the Go series navigators which sell for well over $200 and adopts much of their features too (like traffic, bluetooth, voice recognition, etc).I've never owned a Garmin device so I am not able to compare it to one...but I'm a loyal TomTom user with this being my 3rd navigator in 5 years.Let's start with the mount.  This is the first TomTom navigator to have a functional mount.  My two previous models TomTom XL and TomTom One 140S featured mounts that kept on falling off the windshield, beanbag mount or the dashboard ring disc.  I ultimately had to purchase 3rd party mounts which then worked flawlessly.  This particular model has the suction cup mount built in to the device and is not removable (thus a 3rd party mount will not work).  However the suction cup mount attaches perfectly to my windshield or ring disc and seems to be able to stick (except for a couple times where I probably didn't tighten it enough).  And also this device has no upside down or rightside up...it will work in any direction as the screen always flips to the correct position.The first thing most users do with a GPS Navigator is install updated maps and software.  TomTom users may be familiar with the TomTom Home program...but this and other newer devices do not work with that software.  It uses the MyTomTom software, which runs within a web browser.  There's very few things you can do with the program...pretty much all you can do is download updates.  Other users seemed to have fits with downloading/installing updates and also entering in the lifetime map update code.  I had no such problem.  Updated software and maps were quickly installed in one try (took about an hour) and I was able to enter the code (and confirmed with TomTom that it was set-up on my device).  So as of now, problems with updating and entering code must have been resolved.Next is the quality of maps and interface.  Everything is much improved from the previous iteration.  Maps look modern (rather than cartoonish) the status bar is slick and the setting/menus are less cluttered.  Again I can't compare to Garmin but I always found TomTom's interface and maps to be good and the new look is even better than the old.The voice recognition system is pretty limited but for entering addresses, I found it pretty accurate.  Turn off your radio and speak in the address clearly before mounting the navigator...then it should work fine.  There are other commands you can use while driving, but much are unnecessary.  I concur with others complaining how slow the list of cities get displayed when inputting by hand...there definite is some lag time, but not too bad.  As for the talking voice...there is only one voice (default) that is able to read out all the street names.  Custom and other voices (like Darth Vader/Homer Simpson will not support reading street names) and as of now it appears like MyTomTom doesn't support adding new voices.  This device's voice certainly reads much better than previous models.  Unlike my 140S which used to read 405 and 105 as 4 WEST 5 and 1 WEST 5, this device speaks properly and its pronunciation of most cities are correct.Satellite Capture & Directions...most of the the time a satellite will be locked in within 45-90 seconds on average, slightly faster than older models and on par with others.  Quality of directions...due to the IQ Routes feature, sometimes it'll try and be a little too cute and fancy and direct you through residential streets for a strip mall that is located on a big street.  The directions aren't wrong but are a bit obscure at times.  But for the most part it will find you the best route.  And also it tells you if the business is on the left or the right, which is very helpful (something previous TomToms did not do).Traffic...the traffic monitor is a godsend for those living in high-traffic areas like LA as the device will direct you to the best route based on traffic.  Those heading east and west from and to Los Angeles have many choices (5, 60, 10, 210) freeways.  This will accurately tell you which one is best to take.  Also it constantly monitors the traffic at all times and updates your estimate time of arrival and if traffic gets too bad, it could redirect you.  You could also direct the device to redirect you.  The traffic antenna is built in on the power DC cable, so running on battery or a 3rd party cable will disable this feature.  This feature is a bit slow at times, and can keep the device preoccupied for like 5 minutes...wish it had a faster processor.Bluetooth...I bought the 1435 over the 1405 because of bluetooth.  It was set-up very easily with my phone (Samsung Focus).  It should work fine with most modern phones like Samsung Galaxy S derived phones, iPhone, blackberries, etc.  Some older and cheaper phones may not work, so check with TomTom before buying.  It easily connected, imported my phonebook and is able to call out, receive calls and text messages while on.  The sound isn't crystal clear...but I can hear them but they can't always hear me.  This is where I'm taking away a star from the review.Appearance/Display...the device is very attractive looking with a metallic-like finish.  I prefer the 4.3"" over the 5"" (bigger is not always better) but older people with bad vision may want to go with the 5"".  The display is by no means high-def and can be very difficult to see during strong sunlight.  But it's very easy on the eyes and is crisply visible at most times (always during nights).

In doing a recent update for the latest the maps, the device ""bricked"" and has been rendered useless. I have been unable to load the maps and the existing maps were lost. Now as the device is out of warranty, TomTom is unable to help. I am working with Visa (since it was purchased with the Amazon card and warranties are extended by 1 year) for a possible repair or replacement. I did initially like this device due to the high end features you get for the low price, but its unreliability and now breakdown makes it a device that should not be bought.Update as of 8/12/2011There has been a couple of software updates for this device which makes the device more reliable...I do now notice that bluetooth calling clarity has improved a bit, directions with traffic is calculated faster and lastly voice recognition has greatly improved. It was unfortunate that TomTom initially released a buggy device, but they are fixing it, so the first thing that everyone should do with this device after getting it, is to update the software.The TomTom Via series of GPS Navigators replace an aging line of TomTom One derived models. The Via adopts the ""new look"" maps and interface as adopted from the Go series navigators which sell for well over $200 and adopts much of their features too (like traffic, bluetooth, voice recognition, etc).I've never owned a Garmin device so I am not able to compare it to one...but I'm a loyal TomTom user with this being my 3rd navigator in 5 years.Let's start with the mount. This is the first TomTom navigator to have a functional mount. My two previous models TomTom XL and TomTom One 140S featured mounts that kept on falling off the windshield, beanbag mount or the dashboard ring disc. I ultimately had to purchase 3rd party mounts which then worked flawlessly. This particular model has the suction cup mount built in to the device and is not removable (thus a 3rd party mount will not work). However the suction cup mount attaches perfectly to my windshield or ring disc and seems to be able to stick (except for a couple times where I probably didn't tighten it enough). And also this device has no upside down or rightside up...it will work in any direction as the screen always flips to the correct position.The first thing most users do with a GPS Navigator is install updated maps and software. TomTom users may be familiar with the TomTom Home program...but this and other newer devices do not work with that software. It uses the MyTomTom software, which runs within a web browser. There's very few things you can do with the program...pretty much all you can do is download updates. Other users seemed to have fits with downloading/installing updates and also entering in the lifetime map update code. I had no such problem. Updated software and maps were quickly installed in one try (took about an hour) and I was able to enter the code (and confirmed with TomTom that it was set-up on my device). So as of now, problems with updating and entering code must have been resolved.Next is the quality of maps and interface. Everything is much improved from the previous iteration. Maps look modern (rather than cartoonish) the status bar is slick and the setting/menus are less cluttered. Again I can't compare to Garmin but I always found TomTom's interface and maps to be good and the new look is even better than the old.The voice recognition system is pretty limited but for entering addresses, I found it pretty accurate. Turn off your radio and speak in the address clearly before mounting the navigator...then it should work fine. There are other commands you can use while driving, but much are unnecessary. I concur with others complaining how slow the list of cities get displayed when inputting by hand...there definite is some lag time, but not too bad. As for the talking voice...there is only one voice (default) that is able to read out all the street names. Custom and other voices (like Darth Vader/Homer Simpson will not support reading street names) and as of now it appears like MyTomTom doesn't support adding new voices. This device's voice certainly reads much better than previous models. Unlike my 140S which used to read 405 and 105 as 4 WEST 5 and 1 WEST 5, this device speaks properly and its pronunciation of most cities are correct.Satellite Capture & Directions...most of the the time a satellite will be locked in within 45-90 seconds on average, slightly faster than older models and on par with others. Quality of directions...due to the IQ Routes feature, sometimes it'll try and be a little too cute and fancy and direct you through residential streets for a strip mall that is located on a big street. The directions aren't wrong but are a bit obscure at times. But for the most part it will find you the best route. And also it tells you if the business is on the left or the right, which is very helpful (something previous TomToms did not do).Traffic...the traffic monitor is a godsend for those living in high-traffic areas like LA as the device will direct you to the best route based on traffic. Those heading east and west from and to Los Angeles have many choices (5, 60, 10, 210) freeways. This will accurately tell you which one is best to take. Also it constantly monitors the traffic at all times and updates your estimate time of arrival and if traffic gets too bad, it could redirect you. You could also direct the device to redirect you. The traffic antenna is built in on the power DC cable, so running on battery or a 3rd party cable will disable this feature. This feature is a bit slow at times, and can keep the device preoccupied for like 5 minutes...wish it had a faster processor.Bluetooth...I bought the 1435 over the 1405 because of bluetooth. It was set-up very easily with my phone (Samsung Focus). It should work fine with most modern phones like Samsung Galaxy S derived phones, iPhone, blackberries, etc. Some older and cheaper phones may not work, so check with TomTom before buying. It easily connected, imported my phonebook and is able to call out, receive calls and text messages while on. The sound isn't crystal clear...but I can hear them but they can't always hear me. This is where I'm taking away a star from the review.Appearance/Display...the device is very attractive looking with a metallic-like finish. I prefer the 4.3"" over the 5"" (bigger is not always better) but older people with bad vision may want to go with the 5"". The display is by no means high-def and can be very difficult to see during strong sunlight. But it's very easy on the eyes and is crisply visible at most times (always during nights). As with most GPS navigators, the touch response can be annoying (resistive display versus capacative of smartphones). You may have to tap the screen multiple times to get a reaction, so try pressing firmly and on the proper spot. Also when picking businesses from a list, it may take several presses to pick.

The S120's were pretty decent speakers for $10, but just didn't cut it for any truly ""serious"" listening to music, movies, etc.  I really didn't expect much out a pair of $50 speakers, either, but again, I really just needed some speakers to get me by that were a step up from the Logitech.  After reading some promising reviews as well as some highly critical reviews, I decided to go ahead and take a chance with the 1250's.  Am I ever glad I did!  These little things are outstanding for their price point!  Just bear in mind, you are NOT going to be getting the equivalent of a $300+ set of speakers here.  You are getting $50 speakers.  Keep that in mind, and as such, they are flat unbelievable.  Now I will say this:  you absolutely MUST have some kind of equalizer on your system to really get the most of this system.  That is true of most speaker systems.  My Asus computer has a pretty powerful RealTek HD audio manager installed that can really tweak these little things to a high degree for any style of music or other sounds that I can throw at them.  I have played rock, jazz, classical, acapella vocal music through them and it all sounds fantastic.  I will say, however, that these speakers are not designed for a larger room.  If that is your need, I would look elsewhere.  In my case, I simply wanted a good set of speakers to use with my computer which I use in an area of my home that is relatively small (12' x 10').One thing I absolutely love about these speakers--aside from their sound quality--is the independent volume control which handles both the subwoofer as well as the two satellite speakers.  This stand alone unit also has inputs for headphones, which I have not tried simply because I have no need to use headphones in my situation.  Yes, it takes up another small piece of my desk real estate, but I would much rather have the convenience of being able to control the volume of my speakers with this than having to either rely on software or worse, bending over to find the controls on the speakers. By the way, setup was a no-brainer.  I had them up and running in less than 10 minutes.  Some people have made mention of the design; both positive and negative.  Personally, I really don't care about such matters.  For me, it's all about performance and sound.  Having said that, I actually think they look kinda cool.  I suppose more ""conservative"" tastes might disagree, but I'll leave that to the individual.Is there a down side to the 1250's? A lot of fuss has been made about the bright blue light on the front of the volume controller and they aren't wrong.  While it doesn't bother me in the least while working on my computer, I do turn the unit off at night.  It is one damn bright light!  I am quite sure that there are many people out there who might choose to play music throughout the night on their computer and so could certainly be annoyed by the light, so all I can say is get some tape and cover that sucker up.  A bright light would be a pretty poor reason not to purchase these very good speakers, in my opinion.  You'd be excluding yourself from perhaps one of the better bargains around in terms of $50 speakers.I have only two real caveats that I have found:  (1) if your expectations are that these can be used for a large party or room, forget it and (2)if you don't have some decent equalizer software for your sound card, get some.  In my opinion, you will never be able to tweak ANY speaker system properly without at least having access to some basic equalization controls.  All of us have different preferences, so this is pretty fundamental.  Some of the negative reviews I read before purchasing dealt with the supposed lack in different parts of the frequency spectrum.  Several people complained, for example, of the lack of midrange, others for something else.  While I don't claim to be some sort of expert audiophile, I am a professional musician and have taught music for many years and conducted many bands and choirs, so I think I am at least qualified enough to know ""good"" from ""bad"" sounding speakers.  Which leads me to the opinion that those who made negative comments about these speakers would probably be better served by considerably more expensive and larger speaker systems.  From my point of view, I think these are probably among the best $50 speakers you're going to find.  I'm sure there are some other good ones out there as well.  After all, I am not in the position of being able to compare them all, but I will say that you will most likely be very pleased with these as long as you don't have any unrealistic expectations about them.To sum up, the Genius SW-2.1 1250 speakers are a true bargain and great little speakers at a great price.

It's definitely a lot more powerful and fuller featured than a pico projector like the 3M, but less bright with less contrast than the BenQ W7000.Basically, the PowerLite Home Cinema 2000 is good enough to use in a budget-conscious home theater setting if you choose, but it's compact enough, light enough and easy enough to adjust that it can easily be used for presentations while traveling or for the best backyard movie watching experiences you can imagine. There are easy to adjust legs on the front and back of the projector to help aim, and keystone controls right on the projector itself to make it easy to keep the image nice and square.The brightness is enough that you can see the movie decently with the lights on so don't fear if you don't have a completely light-controlled room to project in.For that matter, you don't need a big room, either! The throw distance is ridiculously good on this thing. I sat the Cinema 2000 on a tray in front of my recliner and it was able to fill the better part of a 109"" projection screen from only about 10' away (which is better than the BenQ!).Also, for those curious, the 3D is great! I bought a pair of cheapOkeba Ultralight RF glassesto try out the capabilities and, let me tell you, watching Life of Pi, Hugo, and Titanic in 3D on a 100"" screen will make your JAW DROP!With the portability and 3D capabilities, I'm a little tempted to project a 3D movie on the back of my house on some warm evening!The only thing I didn't like about the projector was how hot it got. The bottom heats up enough that you'll want to let it cool off before handling it (which isn't uncommon for such projectors, but worth mentioning nevertheless).Overall this is an excellent value, and an easy choice for those wanting to enter into 1080p and/or 3D image on a large scale!

There are easy to adjust legs on the front and back of the projector to help aim, and keystone controls right on the projector itself to make it easy to keep the image nice and square.The brightness is enough that you can see the movie decently with the lights on so don't fear if you don't have a completely light-controlled room to project in.For that matter, you don't need a big room, either! The throw distance is ridiculously good on this thing. I sat the Cinema 2000 on a tray in front of my recliner and it was able to fill the better part of a 109"" projection screen from only about 10' away (which is better than the BenQ!).Also, for those curious, the 3D is great! I bought a pair of cheapOkeba Ultralight RF glassesto try out the capabilities and, let me tell you, watching Life of Pi, Hugo, and Titanic in 3D on a 100"" screen will make your JAW DROP!With the portability and 3D capabilities, I'm a little tempted to project a 3D movie on the back of my house on some warm evening!The only thing I didn't like about the projector was how hot it got. The bottom heats up enough that you'll want to let it cool off before handling it (which isn't uncommon for such projectors, but worth mentioning nevertheless).Overall this is an excellent value, and an easy choice for those wanting to enter into 1080p and/or 3D image on a large scale! At the price point, you could get a 100""+ image for about the price of a 60"" TV!",Stunning and Portable 3D 1080p Picture?

A1QW4Z6OEQLXEA,B0035FZJHQ,JT,"[5, 5]","I love this camera. It's pretty much everything the truly budget filmmaker could want. It takes beautiful stills, and the video is incomparable in its price range. The LCD is brilliant, and the low light capability is fantastic--but more on these gems later.Build Quality: This is pretty one area where I fell it could be improved. I like my cameras to feel solid, and, while it's perfectly decent feeling, it's doesn't have that impenetrable feeling. That being said, if you wanted that, you should be buying the 60D or 7D. Switches and dials are just fine and I haven't had any wear and tear issues anywhere, despite heavy use.Usability: I like it. That being said, it's a very personal preference. I would have liked to have more dedicated dials. With the button-dial combinations, it's perfectly adequate, if not optimal, though. Once again, could use a bit of improvement. Battery life is good, I've found, but you should always have extras on hand, especially when shooting video (really a necessity).LCD: I had to put this in a separate section because it's so good. Magnifique. Pictures and video look brilliant. I can even pull focus on it without needing an LCDVF.Image Qality: Stills look fantastic on this. Paired with the right lens and photographer, you are definitely looking at some good shots. Noise level is good, although in very low-light situations, RAW photos can start to look sketchy, so I'd suggest sticking to JPEG for this purpose unless you have a quality RAW convert with good noise reduction. ISO performance is really good. Paired with the 50mm f/1.8, I feel like a king, walking around shooting without a flash while the other poor people can only stand by and hope their shots don't look like they came from the floor of a Jersey shore nightclub.Video Quality: This is why I bought this camera, and it hasn't let me down. If you pair this with Marvels Cine, or Cinestyle picture styles, you get some pretty meaty dynamic range, which works very nicely in post for color correction. Noise is truly great for this price range. ISO ranges all the way to 1600 are usable for film work, especially after color correction. (Make sure to use a flat picture style!) Although this uses an APS-C crop sensor, that can hardly be avoided unless you have a few grand to drop, and I haven't found it hard to get the depth of field I'm looking for without sacrificing framing, especially with faster lenses.Audio: While you may be thinking it's impossible to get decent in camera audio, think again. If you have Magic Lantern installed, and you should definitely for shooting film, you can easily disable Auto Gain Control (AGC). This, paired with a decent mic preamp (which doesn't have to cost a lot--see the ART USB Dual Pre) can give you really excellent results. Good enough, I dare say, for festival work.Overall: Frankly, I'd like to give this camera an award for budget filmmaking. There is one Caveat though: This award-winning capability is predisposed on have Magic Lantern firmware installed. I won't explain all it can do here, but please, please look into it if you're thinking of buying a T2i/T3i. Without it, it's merely a five-star camera.

Featuring a class-leading 18.0-megapixel CMOS image sensor and increased light sensitivity for low light photography, the EOS Rebel T2i also has an advanced HD Movie mode for gorgeous Full HD movies. Able to capture up to 3.7 frames per second, it's ready to go the minute it's picked up. Advanced Live View, a new wide-area screen, plus features like Canon's brilliant Auto Lighting Optimizer and Highlight Tone features ensure brilliant photos and movies, easily. With some of the most advanced features of any digital SLR, it's simply the best Rebel Canon has ever created.EOS Rebel T2i Highlights18.0-megapixel CMOS (APS-C) sensor and DIGIC 4 Image ProcessorThe EOS Rebel T2i has an 18.0-megapixel CMOS sensor that captures images with exceptional clarity and tonal range and offers more than enough resolution for big enlargements or crops. This first-class sensor features many of the same new technologies as used by professional Canon cameras to maximize each pixel's light-gathering efficiency. Its APS-C size sensor creates an effective 1.6x field of view (compared to 35mm format).DIGIC 4 Image ProcessorThe Canon DIGIC 4 Image Processor dramatically speeds up the entire EOS Rebel T2i's camera operations for intuitive operation and offers improvements in both fine detail and natural color reproduction. It works in concert with the EOS Rebel T2i's CMOS Image Sensor to achieve phenomenal levels of performance in nearly any situation.Capture stunning shots in low light.ISO 100-6400 (expandable to 12800) for shooting from bright to dim lightThe EOS Rebel T2i features an expanded ISO range that makes shooting possible in situations previously unthinkable without flash. With an ISO rating up to 6400 (expandable to ISO 12800), along with the DIGIC 4 Image Processor's improved noise-reduction technology, creative possibilities abound. Combine the EOS Rebel T2i with one of Canon's EF or EF-S lenses with Optical Image Stabilizer and the shooting possibilities for both movies and stills expand even further.Improved EOS Movie mode with manual exposure controlDesigned for the evolving, tech-savvy user, the EOS Rebel T2i features HD Video capture technologies--manual exposure control for more creative control, for example--borrowed directly from professional Canon SLRs to capture stellar video with all the benefits of shooting with an SLR. By shooting video with the EOS Rebel T2i, photographers as well as filmmakers can take advantage of the creative features native to SLR cameras. Along with its manual controls, the EOS Rebel T2i allows for full use of Canon EF and EF-S lenses, including Macro and Fisheye, providing a plethora of shooting options once reserved only for still photography. The resulting HD video is a standout in its beautiful depth-of-field characteristics and remarkable capture capability under poor lighting conditions. In a first for EOS cameras, a Movie Crop function is included: An SD-quality movie (640 x 480) can be cropped to the equivalent of about 7x magnification of regular shooting.Video can be captured at a number of resolutions and frame rates for numerous applications. It can capture 1920 x 1080 Full HD video at frame rates of 24 (23.976), 25 or 30 (29.97) frames per second, for up to 4GB per clip. Movies are saved as MOV files and can be viewed in Full HD through the EOS Rebel T2i's HDMI output. Other recording sizes include HD at 1280 x 720 (50/60 (59.94) fps) or SD/VGA at 640 x 480 (50/60 (59.94) fps). The EOS Rebel T2i has a built-in microphone for simple mono recording and stereo sound can be recorded through a self-powered external microphone.Enhanced 63-zone, Dual-layer metering system, and 9-point AF systemThe EOS Rebel T2i features Canon's newest Dual-layer sensor, with 63-zones. By measuring not only the amount of light, but also taking into account color and luminosity, this new system delivers a very high level of accuracy for better results every time. Since the metering sensor has a color measurement function, exposure errors and focus errors caused by different light sources are minimized; the EOS Rebel T2i gives stable exposure from shot to shot in situations where light changes, such as sports on a cloudy day, or indoor holiday scenes.Additionally, the EOS Rebel T2i has a high-precision, 9-point AF system utilizing a high-precision, f/2.8 cross-type center point. The 9-point AF system uses both normal and high-precision focus depending on the aperture and available light. The 9 focus points can be chosen automatically or manually selected.Wide 3.0-inch (3:2 aspect ratio) Clear View LCD monitorThe EOS Rebel T2i has a high-resolution 3.0-inch Clear View LCD monitor that features 1.04 million dots/VGA for spectacular detail. It also has the same aspect ratio (3:2) as the camera's sensor, making for clear and easy Live View composition. An anti-reflective and water-repellant coating provides a clearer and more smudge-resistant surface and screen brightness can be adjusted in 7 steps in accordance with ambient light.New Quick Control Screen buttonThe EOS Rebel T2i's refined button layout includes a dedicated button that directs the camera immediately to the Quick Control screen, where it's simple to navigate among any number of settings, including ISO, Exposure and Flash Exposure compensation, drive mode, white balance, image quality and much, much more.Improved layout with dedicated Live View/Movie shooting buttonWithout the need to navigate through a bunch of menus, the EOS Rebel T2i transitions effortlessly between still and movie mode. By pressing the Live View/Movie button, a situation that had required menu access with other cameras, still images can change to a movie shoot and vice versa. It's literally as simple as the press of a button.3.7fps continuous shooting up to approximately 34 JPEGs or approximately 6 RAWThe EOS Rebel T2i can shoot up to 3.7 frames per second (fps) for up to approximately 6 consecutive RAW files or approximately 34 full-resolution JPEGs. Shooting at speeds of up to 1/4000 sec., the EOS Rebel T2i can capture even rapidly-unfolding scenes with ease.New compatibility with SDXC memory cardsThe EOS Rebel T2i is compatible with both SDXC memory cards for greater storage capacity and with Eye-Fi SD cards, which are outfitted with a Wi-Fi transmitter (IEEE 802.11b/g) and internal antenna for wireless, high speed transfer of images. With an Eye-Fi card installed, the EOS Rebel T2i can display the Eye-Fi's connection status and error notes with ease, for fully functional wireless uploading of images directly from the camera.*Canon cameras are not guaranteed to support Eye-Fi card functions, including wireless transfer. In case of an issue with the Eye-Fi card, please consult with the card manufacturer. The use of Eye-Fi cards may not be available outside the United States and Canada, please contact the card manufacturer for territory availability.Compatible with the full line of Canon EF and EF-S lensesEF LensesThe EOS Rebel T2i is compatible with all Canon lenses in the EF lineup, including compact and lightweight EF-S lenses, ranging from ultra-wide angle to super telephoto lenses. Canon lenses employ advanced optical expertise and micron-precision engineering to deliver outstanding performance and deliver beautiful results. Special technologies like the Canon Image Stabilizer technology in select lenses helps to minimize the effect of camera shake, effectively adding up to four stops of light. With a dizzying array of lenses perfect for travel, sports, still life and everything in between, photographers can truly maximize the quality and performance of their EOS Rebel T2i with superlative Canon optics.SoftwareCanon EOS Digital Solution Disk (Version 22.0)The EOS Rebel T2i comes bundled with a Canon EOS Digital Solution Disk, which features powerful software programs designed to extend the EOS experience to the computer.

Featuring a class-leading 18.0-megapixel CMOS image sensor and increased light sensitivity for low light photography, the EOS Rebel T2i also has an advanced HD Movie mode for gorgeous Full HD movies. Able to capture up to 3.7 frames per second, it's ready to go the minute it's picked up. Advanced Live View, a new wide-area screen, plus features like Canon's brilliant Auto Lighting Optimizer and Highlight Tone features ensure brilliant photos and movies, easily. With some of the most advanced features of any digital SLR, it's simply the best Rebel Canon has ever created.EOS Rebel T2i Highlights18.0-megapixel CMOS (APS-C) sensor and DIGIC 4 Image ProcessorThe EOS Rebel T2i has an 18.0-megapixel CMOS sensor that captures images with exceptional clarity and tonal range and offers more than enough resolution for big enlargements or crops. This first-class sensor features many of the same new technologies as used by professional Canon cameras to maximize each pixel's light-gathering efficiency. Its APS-C size sensor creates an effective 1.6x field of view (compared to 35mm format).DIGIC 4 Image ProcessorThe Canon DIGIC 4 Image Processor dramatically speeds up the entire EOS Rebel T2i's camera operations for intuitive operation and offers improvements in both fine detail and natural color reproduction. It works in concert with the EOS Rebel T2i's CMOS Image Sensor to achieve phenomenal levels of performance in nearly any situation.Capture stunning shots in low light.ISO 100-6400 (expandable to 12800) for shooting from bright to dim lightThe EOS Rebel T2i features an expanded ISO range that makes shooting possible in situations previously unthinkable without flash. With an ISO rating up to 6400 (expandable to ISO 12800), along with the DIGIC 4 Image Processor's improved noise-reduction technology, creative possibilities abound. Combine the EOS Rebel T2i with one of Canon's EF or EF-S lenses with Optical Image Stabilizer and the shooting possibilities for both movies and stills expand even further.Improved EOS Movie mode with manual exposure controlDesigned for the evolving, tech-savvy user, the EOS Rebel T2i features HD Video capture technologies--manual exposure control for more creative control, for example--borrowed directly from professional Canon SLRs to capture stellar video with all the benefits of shooting with an SLR. By shooting video with the EOS Rebel T2i, photographers as well as filmmakers can take advantage of the creative features native to SLR cameras. Along with its manual controls, the EOS Rebel T2i allows for full use of Canon EF and EF-S lenses, including Macro and Fisheye, providing a plethora of shooting options once reserved only for still photography. The resulting HD video is a standout in its beautiful depth-of-field characteristics and remarkable capture capability under poor lighting conditions. In a first for EOS cameras, a Movie Crop function is included: An SD-quality movie (640 x 480) can be cropped to the equivalent of about 7x magnification of regular shooting.Video can be captured at a number of resolutions and frame rates for numerous applications. It can capture 1920 x 1080 Full HD video at frame rates of 24 (23.976), 25 or 30 (29.97) frames per second, for up to 4GB per clip. Movies are saved as MOV files and can be viewed in Full HD through the EOS Rebel T2i's HDMI output. Other recording sizes include HD at 1280 x 720 (50/60 (59.94) fps) or SD/VGA at 640 x 480 (50/60 (59.94) fps). The EOS Rebel T2i has a built-in microphone for simple mono recording and stereo sound can be recorded through a self-powered external microphone.Enhanced 63-zone, Dual-layer metering system, and 9-point AF systemThe EOS Rebel T2i features Canon's newest Dual-layer sensor, with 63-zones. By measuring not only the amount of light, but also taking into account color and luminosity, this new system delivers a very high level of accuracy for better results every time. Since the metering sensor has a color measurement function, exposure errors and focus errors caused by different light sources are minimized; the EOS Rebel T2i gives stable exposure from shot to shot in situations where light changes, such as sports on a cloudy day, or indoor holiday scenes.Additionally, the EOS Rebel T2i has a high-precision, 9-point AF system utilizing a high-precision, f/2.8 cross-type center point. The 9-point AF system uses both normal and high-precision focus depending on the aperture and available light. The 9 focus points can be chosen automatically or manually selected.Wide 3.0-inch (3:2 aspect ratio) Clear View LCD monitorThe EOS Rebel T2i has a high-resolution 3.0-inch Clear View LCD monitor that features 1.04 million dots/VGA for spectacular detail. It also has the same aspect ratio (3:2) as the camera's sensor, making for clear and easy Live View composition. An anti-reflective and water-repellant coating provides a clearer and more smudge-resistant surface and screen brightness can be adjusted in 7 steps in accordance with ambient light.New Quick Control Screen buttonThe EOS Rebel T2i's refined button layout includes a dedicated button that directs the camera immediately to the Quick Control screen, where it's simple to navigate among any number of settings, including ISO, Exposure and Flash Exposure compensation, drive mode, white balance, image quality and much, much more.Improved layout with dedicated Live View/Movie shooting buttonWithout the need to navigate through a bunch of menus, the EOS Rebel T2i transitions effortlessly between still and movie mode. By pressing the Live View/Movie button, a situation that had required menu access with other cameras, still images can change to a movie shoot and vice versa. It's literally as simple as the press of a button.3.7fps continuous shooting up to approximately 34 JPEGs or approximately 6 RAWThe EOS Rebel T2i can shoot up to 3.7 frames per second (fps) for up to approximately 6 consecutive RAW files or approximately 34 full-resolution JPEGs. Shooting at speeds of up to 1/4000 sec., the EOS Rebel T2i can capture even rapidly-unfolding scenes with ease.New compatibility with SDXC memory cardsThe EOS Rebel T2i is compatible with both SDXC memory cards for greater storage capacity and with Eye-Fi SD cards, which are outfitted with a Wi-Fi transmitter (IEEE 802.11b/g) and internal antenna for wireless, high speed transfer of images. With an Eye-Fi card installed, the EOS Rebel T2i can display the Eye-Fi's connection status and error notes with ease, for fully functional wireless uploading of images directly from the camera.*Canon cameras are not guaranteed to support Eye-Fi card functions, including wireless transfer. In case of an issue with the Eye-Fi card, please consult with the card manufacturer. The use of Eye-Fi cards may not be available outside the United States and Canada, please contact the card manufacturer for territory availability.Compatible with the full line of Canon EF and EF-S lensesEF LensesThe EOS Rebel T2i is compatible with all Canon lenses in the EF lineup, including compact and lightweight EF-S lenses, ranging from ultra-wide angle to super telephoto lenses. Canon lenses employ advanced optical expertise and micron-precision engineering to deliver outstanding performance and deliver beautiful results. Special technologies like the Canon Image Stabilizer technology in select lenses helps to minimize the effect of camera shake, effectively adding up to four stops of light. With a dizzying array of lenses perfect for travel, sports, still life and everything in between, photographers can truly maximize the quality and performance of their EOS Rebel T2i with superlative Canon optics.SoftwareCanon EOS Digital Solution Disk (Version 22.0)The EOS Rebel T2i comes bundled with a Canon EOS Digital Solution Disk, which features powerful software programs designed to extend the EOS experience to the computer.

I'm not sure if I'd even give it two stars if it were just a normal monitor, but this thing not only has a built in DisplayLink chipset for USB video connection bit its also USB powered!

The case might be a little bulkier than it needs to be since it feels hollow, but its not that thick and it fits in my backpack. I wish it had come with a sleeve or something, but I suspect a cheap minimalistic large laptop sleeve would work just fine.So that's the good stuff. Here's the bad: image quality. Compared to laptop displays in general, this one is more comparable to the lower quality displays on cheap laptops.-The viewing angle is horrible. You pretty much have to be looking at the thing dead on or it won't look right, making it very difficult for more than one person to view it at a time. I suppose you could consider this a security feature, but the screen isn't totally unreadable at an off angle, just really bad looking.-The color gamut is horrible. I used a ColorMunki Photo spectrophotometer to calibrate the thing and the resulting gamut plot doesn't come close to covering the standard sRGB color space. Then again, my built in MacBook display doesn't cover sRGB that well either, so it's not that much worse than the typically bad laptop display. My guess is that the image quality is probably comparable to the average screen on an inexpensive laptop.-As others have noted theres no brightness control. There are no controls of any kind on the thing, just a micro USB port and nothing else. The brightness I measured on mine was about 200 cd/m2 which is not bad for a laptop display.-While the built in DisplayLink USB graphics adapter is great in that it only needs a USB port, it lacks a lot of the processing power that a real graphics card with a real GPU would have. So the CPU ends up doing work that would normally be done on a graphics chipset GPU. This means it will use up some CPU power depending on what you're doing, and it's no good for video or games. So this thing is mostly for displaying documents and animated graphics which is good enough for many people.-There's no built in USB hub or anything.

I loves me some tech.Setup was as easy as could be. It recognized by Tivo as video source. It recognized my TV model. It seems to be able to control my Tivo without the (supplied) IR booster. Nice.The keyboard is comfortable.The firmware/OS that came with the unit (2.x) was functional, but hard to navigate. (I say this as someone who has designed interfaces and works with computers every day). Too much ""why is this here?"" and ""what is this supposed to do?""The new update to Honeycomb OS (3.x) is much better. Very streamlined and pretty obvious. It also brings the Android marketplace to this platform, although the number of apps that will run on this platform is currently pathetically small. I went through the list and found nothing I wanted to add...This is a lot of fun for the money.For most people, the big pluses will be the ability to browse Youtube and Netflix, and the ability to use the Google Chrome browser. And the ability to make your current video stream small (picture in picture) while you do it.Downsides include the lack of worthwhile apps in the Market, annoyances related to the Chrome browser (no tabbed browsing being the big one), and no native support for features such as Amazon streaming video (which is, at present, accessed through the Chrome browser).I'd say with the Honeycomb update, this feels like a B-level product, ready to make it to the A-level with the next major update.And there's the rub. You see, Logitech has discontinued this product after losing around $100 MILLION on the failed launch (they built a ton of them, expecting big sales. They sold very few and got a huge number of returns on top of that). They're done. They added that they won't be getting back into the Google game anytime soon. So this is an orphan product.That means that future updates to the OS are in question. Google could push them across--and that's not entirely unrealistic. But you can't be sure that will happen. If it does not--if the current updated OS is the last this unit will ever see--then I'd say it's fun, and it offers plenty for the price, but in some sense it's more tantalizing that essential.Logitech's end of support also means that third party vendors and content providers (such as Amazon) aren't going to have a whole lot of impetus to create native apps for this platform. It's not horrible using Chrome to access Amazon video streaming, but it could be a lot nicer.So where does that leave us? Assuming this is the end product, this is still a win for gadget freaks, and for people who want to bring some Internet content to their TVs (and who don't either have a PC connected to the TV or have a high end smart TV with those functions). Integration of Web searches with the video source is pretty swell (type ""ABC"" and your video source changes to the ABC network; or you can see a nice display of movies that are currently on--with pictures of the ""video boxes"" and synopses--and this search is also interactive with your video source). But with a Q/A or experience design hat on, I'd say that this product is converging on great, but not quite there. I can see where the dots are, and how you'd want to connect them.

The only thing that I did not like is the giant white lettering announcing that it is a 4 PORT USB HUB. So I took a the dremmel and scraped off all the white lettering so it is all black now. These usb ports have more power than the ones that are native to my Shuttle case.

Yes, startup is slow (if you are in iA mode, faster in dedicated movie mode), especially for the first clip.

This stylish and innovative camera will fit perfectly into your active life. Waterproof, shockproof, dustproof, freeze-proof, HD movies, 3D photos, Sweep Panorama, and a touch screen, this powerful tool follows you to the edge and proves you were there.Sony DSC-TX10 Feature HighlightsRugged and StylishThis camera is just as much at home in the water as on a night on the town! The sleek and stylish TX10 fits the slimmest pocket or purse, yet is waterproof to a depth of 16 ft10, shockproof from falls up to approximately 5 ft9and dustproof12thanks to its airtight construction. As well, this durable camera can even withstand extreme weather conditions, as it is operable in temperatures from 14- to 104-degrees Fahrenheit11. Seamlessly shifting from underwater marvels to a night on the town, the TX10 always makes it easy to get the best shot!3-inch Touch screen A large 3-inch touch screen LCD makes it easy for viewing and sharing images with simple and fun touch operation.16.2 Megapixel Back-illuminated “Exmor R” CMOS Image SensorThe DSC-TX10 features a 16.2 megapixel “Exmor R” CMOS image sensor that brings out the full resolving power of the camera’s Carl Zeiss Vario-Tessar lens to deliver extremely fast speed, high resolution, and stunning low-light sensitivity with improved image clarity and drastically reduced grain. In addition, the combined “Exmor R” CMOS sensor and BIONZ image processor delivers extremely fast 10fps, Anti Motion Blur, Hand-held Twilight and 1080i movie modes7.Full HD 1080@60i Record crystal clear movies at the highest resolution available with capabilities for 60i in 1080 Full HD3. This provides stunning, fast motion video with less distortion for playback on your HD TV.3D still image Produce awe-inspiring images with 3D still image and 3D Sweep Panorama capabilities. Images will take on a new dimension to view the world in a whole new way5.iSweep Panorama With iSweep Panorama just press the shutter, pan the landscape and let the camera do the rest. It automatically links together each frame to produce a panoramic image. This model even detects faces and moving subjects to stitch intelligently different widths to help avoid subject distortion.Background Defocus DSLR photographs are often beautiful because they blur the background, putting the emphasis on the subject. Now our point-and-shoot cameras can deliver this signature DSLR benefit. The system takes two shots, identifies the background and applies a defocused background keeping the subject crisp and clear.Superior Auto Mode Get cleaner, more dynamic pictures and fewer missed shots. The camera automatically recognizes the correct scene mode, then quickly shoots and combines up to six shots to produce images with greater clarity, optimum dynamic range using backlight correction HDR technology and lower image noise using 6 shots layering technology. Superior Auto intelligently detects 36 scenes for still images and movies, making it easy to get the best shot.Soft Skin Mode Portrait subjects will love the results. Soft Skin mode recognizes skin tones and reduces the appearance of blemishes and wrinkles without affecting the rest of the shot. Natural Flash Conventional point-and-shoot camera flash shots just don't capture colors the way the eye sees them. Natural Flash mode takes a reference shot without flash and then uses that reference to correct the color, for far more lifelike images.High speed shootingThe DSC-TX10 can capture full 16.2 megapixel resolution images at up to 10 frames per second, helping to ensure that the decisive moment is captured such as the soccer ball flying into the goal. In addition, the DSC-TX10 employs a mechanical shutter that helps reduce distortion when continuously shooting moving subjects.Carl Zeiss Vario-Tessar Lens with 25mm equivalent wide 4x Optical ZoomThe high-performance Carl Zeiss Vario-Tessar 4x optical zoom lens brings distant subjects closer for video recording as well as for outdoor, sports, and travel photos, and Close Focus shoots close-ups up to just under ½-inch from the subject. A wide angle of 25mm equivalent wide-angle lens allows you to take wider shots of the scene or group in crowded spaces.HDMI output The High-Definition Multimedia Interface (HDMI) is a compact audio/video connector interface for transmitting uncompressed digital streams. HDMI connects digital audio/video sources such as a compatible camcorder, Blu-ray Disc player, a personal computer, a video game console, or an AV receiver to a compatible digital audio device and/or video monitor such as a digital television (DTV). Easily connect your Cyber-shot camera via HDMI cable to any compatible HDMI compatible device to easily enjoy and upload content7.Smile Shutter technologySmile Shutter technology captures a smile the moment it happens. Simply press the Smile Shutter button and the camera does the rest. Also select adult and child priority and indicate the degree of Smile Detection Sensitivity. Intelligent Scene Recognition can be used together with Smile Shutter mode. This means that beautiful smiles can be captured with settings optimized for the particular scene, even in difficult conditions such as twilight and backlighting.Face Detection technologySony’s Face Detection technology can automatically distinguish between children and adults. Face Detection technology detects up to eight individual faces and adjusts flash, focus, exposure, and white balance to help deliver crisp, properly lit images of family and friends.Motion DetectionMotion Detection, along with Face Motion Detection adjusts ISO sensitivity and increases the shutter speed when movement is detected, reducing blur in moving subjects and faces.Anti-blink FunctionIt’s frustrating to capture the perfect shot, only to review it later and discover subjects blinked during the photo. When the camera is set to Soft Snap, the Anti-blink function captures two images, recording only the photo with less squinting or blinking. If a blink is detected in other shooting modes, a warning will be displayed after you take the shot.Sweep Multi Angle Mode In Sweep Multi Angle mode, the camera takes 15 images at different angles as it sweeps across the scene. By tilting the camera during playback, the camera’s Gyro Sensor detects motion and displays the image in a 3D-like view on the camera’s LCD.Anti-Motion Blur ModeCapture cleaner and sharper images in low light for non landscape shots. When set in Anti-motion Blur Mode, the DSC-TX10 captures six images in a fraction of a second with higher shutter speed and combines the data from all six to create a single image of extraordinary detail and dramatically reduce subject blur, beyond the capability of traditional cameras.Backlight Correction HDRShooting high-contrast scenes can often lead to washed out backgrounds and/or details lost in shadow. Backlight Correction HDR helps correct for this by taking three pictures at different exposure settings and processing the best elements of all three into a single image for more natural looking shots.TransferJet technology TransferJet technology, developed by Sony and advanced and promoted by consortium of 18 other companies, allows the transfer of up to ten files between two TransferJet enabled devices just by touching their TransferJet logos together, without the hassle of hunting for cables or the complication of pairing8.Compatible with PC and MAC Systems The Full HD video captured with the DSC-TX10 can be used with the provided Picture Motion Browser software1 for PC and iMovie (sold separately) for Mac systems.Includes Sony PMB (Picture Motion Browser) Software ver. 5.51Sony Picture Motion Browser software offers a simple, intuitive way to transfer, sort, and view your video and still images on your compatible PC.

As well, this durable camera can even withstand extreme weather conditions, as it is operable in temperatures from 14- to 104-degrees Fahrenheit11. Seamlessly shifting from underwater marvels to a night on the town, the TX10 always makes it easy to get the best shot!3-inch Touch screen A large 3-inch touch screen LCD makes it easy for viewing and sharing images with simple and fun touch operation.16.2 Megapixel Back-illuminated “Exmor R” CMOS Image SensorThe DSC-TX10 features a 16.2 megapixel “Exmor R” CMOS image sensor that brings out the full resolving power of the camera’s Carl Zeiss Vario-Tessar lens to deliver extremely fast speed, high resolution, and stunning low-light sensitivity with improved image clarity and drastically reduced grain. In addition, the combined “Exmor R” CMOS sensor and BIONZ image processor delivers extremely fast 10fps, Anti Motion Blur, Hand-held Twilight and 1080i movie modes7.Full HD 1080@60i Record crystal clear movies at the highest resolution available with capabilities for 60i in 1080 Full HD3. This provides stunning, fast motion video with less distortion for playback on your HD TV.3D still image Produce awe-inspiring images with 3D still image and 3D Sweep Panorama capabilities. Images will take on a new dimension to view the world in a whole new way5.iSweep Panorama With iSweep Panorama just press the shutter, pan the landscape and let the camera do the rest. It automatically links together each frame to produce a panoramic image. This model even detects faces and moving subjects to stitch intelligently different widths to help avoid subject distortion.Background Defocus DSLR photographs are often beautiful because they blur the background, putting the emphasis on the subject. Now our point-and-shoot cameras can deliver this signature DSLR benefit. The system takes two shots, identifies the background and applies a defocused background keeping the subject crisp and clear.Superior Auto Mode Get cleaner, more dynamic pictures and fewer missed shots. The camera automatically recognizes the correct scene mode, then quickly shoots and combines up to six shots to produce images with greater clarity, optimum dynamic range using backlight correction HDR technology and lower image noise using 6 shots layering technology. Superior Auto intelligently detects 36 scenes for still images and movies, making it easy to get the best shot.Soft Skin Mode Portrait subjects will love the results. Soft Skin mode recognizes skin tones and reduces the appearance of blemishes and wrinkles without affecting the rest of the shot. Natural Flash Conventional point-and-shoot camera flash shots just don't capture colors the way the eye sees them. Natural Flash mode takes a reference shot without flash and then uses that reference to correct the color, for far more lifelike images.High speed shootingThe DSC-TX10 can capture full 16.2 megapixel resolution images at up to 10 frames per second, helping to ensure that the decisive moment is captured such as the soccer ball flying into the goal. In addition, the DSC-TX10 employs a mechanical shutter that helps reduce distortion when continuously shooting moving subjects.Carl Zeiss Vario-Tessar Lens with 25mm equivalent wide 4x Optical ZoomThe high-performance Carl Zeiss Vario-Tessar 4x optical zoom lens brings distant subjects closer for video recording as well as for outdoor, sports, and travel photos, and Close Focus shoots close-ups up to just under ½-inch from the subject. A wide angle of 25mm equivalent wide-angle lens allows you to take wider shots of the scene or group in crowded spaces.HDMI output The High-Definition Multimedia Interface (HDMI) is a compact audio/video connector interface for transmitting uncompressed digital streams. HDMI connects digital audio/video sources such as a compatible camcorder, Blu-ray Disc player, a personal computer, a video game console, or an AV receiver to a compatible digital audio device and/or video monitor such as a digital television (DTV). Easily connect your Cyber-shot camera via HDMI cable to any compatible HDMI compatible device to easily enjoy and upload content7.Smile Shutter technologySmile Shutter technology captures a smile the moment it happens. Simply press the Smile Shutter button and the camera does the rest. Also select adult and child priority and indicate the degree of Smile Detection Sensitivity. Intelligent Scene Recognition can be used together with Smile Shutter mode. This means that beautiful smiles can be captured with settings optimized for the particular scene, even in difficult conditions such as twilight and backlighting.Face Detection technologySony’s Face Detection technology can automatically distinguish between children and adults. Face Detection technology detects up to eight individual faces and adjusts flash, focus, exposure, and white balance to help deliver crisp, properly lit images of family and friends.Motion DetectionMotion Detection, along with Face Motion Detection adjusts ISO sensitivity and increases the shutter speed when movement is detected, reducing blur in moving subjects and faces.Anti-blink FunctionIt’s frustrating to capture the perfect shot, only to review it later and discover subjects blinked during the photo. When the camera is set to Soft Snap, the Anti-blink function captures two images, recording only the photo with less squinting or blinking. If a blink is detected in other shooting modes, a warning will be displayed after you take the shot.Sweep Multi Angle Mode In Sweep Multi Angle mode, the camera takes 15 images at different angles as it sweeps across the scene. By tilting the camera during playback, the camera’s Gyro Sensor detects motion and displays the image in a 3D-like view on the camera’s LCD.Anti-Motion Blur ModeCapture cleaner and sharper images in low light for non landscape shots. When set in Anti-motion Blur Mode, the DSC-TX10 captures six images in a fraction of a second with higher shutter speed and combines the data from all six to create a single image of extraordinary detail and dramatically reduce subject blur, beyond the capability of traditional cameras.Backlight Correction HDRShooting high-contrast scenes can often lead to washed out backgrounds and/or details lost in shadow. Backlight Correction HDR helps correct for this by taking three pictures at different exposure settings and processing the best elements of all three into a single image for more natural looking shots.TransferJet technology TransferJet technology, developed by Sony and advanced and promoted by consortium of 18 other companies, allows the transfer of up to ten files between two TransferJet enabled devices just by touching their TransferJet logos together, without the hassle of hunting for cables or the complication of pairing8.Compatible with PC and MAC Systems The Full HD video captured with the DSC-TX10 can be used with the provided Picture Motion Browser software1 for PC and iMovie (sold separately) for Mac systems.Includes Sony PMB (Picture Motion Browser) Software ver. 5.51Sony Picture Motion Browser software offers a simple, intuitive way to transfer, sort, and view your video and still images on your compatible PC. In addition, multiple output options let you burn your memories to DVD using an external DVD burning device (sold separately), as well as take advantage of one click upload to a number of popular video and photo sharing sites (such as Facebook and Sony’s Personal Space). Using the new 5.5 version also enables playback of 3D images taken on the Cyber-shot camera.Includes Sony PMB Portable software2 With the pre-installed Picture Motion Browser (PMB) Portable 5.5 software2the DSC-TX10 makes it easy to pre-select videos and images in the camera and conveniently upload them from the camera to a compatible PC and popular Internet sharing sites8without the need for any additional software or install.PMB requires Microsoft Windows XP SP3/ Windows Vista SP2/Windows 7 environments not supported.

My previous keyboard was a wireless Logitech K270.  While the K270 was light and very convenient to use, I frequently noticed that it missed inputs and ghosted when I was playing BF3.  These missed keys often resulted in my untimely death during close matches in BF3: Close Quarters.Enter the 710+.  Upon initial unboxing, I noticed its significant heft and build quality.  The keyboard felt very solid.  The orange border surrounding the G1-G6 programmable macro keys is a nice visual highlight.  The 710+ comes with an included USB port although you must plug in the additional USB connector in order to gain this functionality.  (Only one of the USB connectors needs to be plugged in to be able to use the keyboard.)  The 710+ is also equipped with backlight dimming buttons, multimedia controls, and a volume scroll bar.  The backlighting looks fantastic at night although I had to tone down the brightness.  The WASD keys are of a different color than the other keys on the keyboard and have separately customizable backlighting.As a regular keyboard, the 710+ is ok for typing.  The layout may make typing slightly difficult because shift-buttons show the shifted keys on the bottom rather than the top and the keys are substantially raised as compared to flatter keys on regular keyboards.  However, thanks to the Cherry MX Brown switches, the keys have a great tactile quality and a muted ""clicking"" sound.  The included wrist-rest felt a little cheap however.As noted, this is a mechanical keyboard that uses Cherry MX Brown switches.  This is my first mechanical gaming keyboard (I don't think my Saitek Eclipse was a mechanical keyboard) so I did a little extra research.  A company called CHERRY makes 90% of all the mechanical switches on the keyboard market and CHERRY makes five different key switches which are classified by color.  Mechanical switches typically offer greater durability and tactile feel over non-mechanical ones.Logitech has used Cherry MX Brown switches, which feature a small click when the key is depressed halfway.  Comparatively, MX Black switches have no click, MX Reds have no click but are even easier to depress than the Blacks, MX Blues have a greater ""click"" than the MX Browns, and MX Clear is similar to MX Brown but requires slightly more force to depress.  I suspect that the MX Browns are probably the ""just right"" selection of the bunch, giving some ""clickyness"" if the keyboard is used for typing and slightly decreased resistance for gaming.  Subjectively, I personally prefer the ""clicky"" keyboards and the 710+ gets it just right.  Logitech also added rubber O-rings beneath each key to mitigate some of the ""clickyness"".  It's a thoughtful, yet simple idea that works well.Further functionality can be achieved using Logitech's excellent Setpoint software.  I didn't install this because I only need the basic WASD keys for FPS gaming, but the software allows a high degree of customization.The 710+ is not cheap by any means.  Why would you get the Logitech over cheaper competitors like the Corsair K90, Razer BlackWidow, or CM Storm series?  Because of Logitech's build quality and warranty.

I put the receiving unit on top of the TV (it measures 3/4"" high, 1-7/8"" wide, and 1"" deep) where it fits very discretely, like the third brake light at the top of a car's rear window. Now, the tricky part... does it work? The answer is a resounding yes. I am now back to lazily pointing the remote in the direction of the TV and Logitech does the rest. The most difficult part of the job was fishing the wires through the mass of other cables at the back of my system. There are two wires that must be fished. One is the power source for the unit, the other is for the receiving unit. The main module operates as both the power supply for the system, as well as the main signal relay unit (blaster). There are two other remote blasters (relay units) which, if used, would also require connection to the main power supply/blaster. I have an amp and a BD player on two different shelves in the center section of my TV cabinet, and only need the main blaster unit to operate them.

There are a few different methods, but basically you synchronize the time on your camera with the time on your phone, leave GPS on, and hit the road. Once you get home, attach the tags to the photos. I'm so glad I don't have to use a cruddy camera just to access that one feature. I haven't picked an app yet, but I'll update when I have.Everything about this camera sounds so good.  I was so excited. I ordered two extra batteries for it at an extremely low price, so I wasn't even worried that the camera doesn't take AA batteries. The camera uses SD and SDHC cards, which are everywhere, and you can even use cellphone cards if you have an adapter. I mean, it sounds brilliant, right? The GPS is hybrid, so it doesn't run the battery down and tagging works even when there isn't a reliable GPS signal. SO GOOD! Right?NO!Every SINGLE photo I have taken with it looks like absolute crap.  It's 14 megapixels of ABSOLUTE CRAP. My damaged five-plus-year-old Canon takes photos 800 times better than this. If you display these photos at 100%, they look like cellphone photos. I got this camera to take photos of wildlife and nature, and have tags to remind me where I was at the time. I thought I could compromise if the image quality weren't quite as good as that of a Canon, but this is unacceptable. Birds look like pixelly smears, even when they're only 15 feet away.Also, the camera is constantly adjusting, loudly, and it sounds like it's about to explode. Furthermore also, the camera stores all of the files in one folder, with its own naming conventions, so you have to download thumbnails for every single photo, even if you just want to look at the last few. Maybe you can change this in settings, but I haven't seen an option for it on the camera or software, or in the manual.I am giving it two stars instead of one because the battery life and low cost allow you to spend hours taking low-quality photos without having to recharge.  Also the GPS is really cool even though it is not useful if the photos are so awful that you don't use the camera. It is more like hypothetically cool. Because I hate it.If you do get a GPS camera, don't forget that it will track your location at home as well, if you forget to turn it off. The GPS data is stored in ""Exif data"" attached to the image file. Many websites (like Amazon) do not strip the Exif data from the image files.  So if you take a photo in your living room and upload it someplace, people will have the exact global position of your couch.  You can download Exif stripper software, or search for ""online Exif stripper"" to find a website that will delete that info for you, and let you save a new copy of the image. Firefox also has a browser extension that will display Exif data, so you can check if your images are giving away private information.Oh, PS: I forgot to say that the flash is right in front of where your hand will be when you hold the camera and press the shutter button. It is difficult to hold the camera without covering the right-hand side of the flash. All I can say is that I am sad. I'm so sad about the camera.UPDATE: Because I can't afford to buy a different new one, I took this camera on a trip to visit bears and other giant animals, and the camera was so frustrating! For some reason, I'd start recording a video but it would turn off again without me noticing. Later I watched the videos and discovered that some of them only had one second of something really cool, and then the video stopped. I think maybe the ""record"" button is too sensitive. Make sure the video is recording before you look away from the camera!The biggest issue on the trip was that the animals moved quickly, and every #$*(&@$ time I took a picture (without flash), it would stop and think about life for maybe 15 seconds afterward. An animal would be doing something awesome, and I'd be frantically pushing the shutter button, but the camera wouldn't take a photo until it was too late. By then I'd have the camera pointed someplace else, the camera would take a picture of my leg or whatever, and I wouldn't be able to take another photo for 15 seconds. This happens when the camera turns on, as well. I think it is dealing with GPS data. But I don't care--it is a huge problem.It also is difficult to get the camera to focus on what you actually want to see. I have a lot of photos of a lot of blurry stuff, but you wouldn't know it from the preview screen, because it usually looks fine there. They don't look blurry until you get home and upload them to your computer.  I took a video of a bear playing in a pond, but...it's just a bunch of blurry stuff moving around the screen.  I couldn't get the camera to refocus. (Although, to be fair, that video was so blurry that I could see the blurriness on the LCD screen, so I had a chance to try to fix it. Although I failed.)We did see a dead cow with a bald eagle on it, and while we didn't get a meaningful photo (guess why), we did go back that way again and we used the GPS to tell us where we'd taken the photo.  It shows the photos on a map with a route highlighted, so you can see where you've been. Really cool. ""Hey, that blurry thing was the varied thrush at the northwesternmost point of the contiguous United States! I remember that! In my head! Who needs photographs?!""  Er... so yeah also the camera has an auto-date and -time function, because of the GPS, so the photos all have the correct date in their data. That is good, too.

It shows the photos on a map with a route highlighted, so you can see where you've been. Really cool. ""Hey, that blurry thing was the varied thrush at the northwesternmost point of the contiguous United States! I remember that! In my head! Who needs photographs?!"" Er... so yeah also the camera has an auto-date and -time function, because of the GPS, so the photos all have the correct date in their data. That is good, too.

By pressing the Live View/Movie button, a situation that had required menu access with other cameras, still images can change to a movie shoot and vice versa. It's literally as simple as the press of a button.3.7fps continuous shooting up to approximately 34 JPEGs or approximately 6 RAWThe EOS Rebel T2i can shoot up to 3.7 frames per second (fps) for up to approximately 6 consecutive RAW files or approximately 34 full-resolution JPEGs. Shooting at speeds of up to 1/4000 sec., the EOS Rebel T2i can capture even rapidly-unfolding scenes with ease.New compatibility with SDXC memory cardsThe EOS Rebel T2i is compatible with both SDXC memory cards for greater storage capacity and with Eye-Fi SD cards, which are outfitted with a Wi-Fi transmitter (IEEE 802.11b/g) and internal antenna for wireless, high speed transfer of images. With an Eye-Fi card installed, the EOS Rebel T2i can display the Eye-Fi's connection status and error notes with ease, for fully functional wireless uploading of images directly from the camera.*Canon cameras are not guaranteed to support Eye-Fi card functions, including wireless transfer. In case of an issue with the Eye-Fi card, please consult with the card manufacturer. The use of Eye-Fi cards may not be available outside the United States and Canada, please contact the card manufacturer for territory availability.Compatible with the full line of Canon EF and EF-S lensesEF LensesThe EOS Rebel T2i is compatible with all Canon lenses in the EF lineup, including compact and lightweight EF-S lenses, ranging from ultra-wide angle to super telephoto lenses. Canon lenses employ advanced optical expertise and micron-precision engineering to deliver outstanding performance and deliver beautiful results. Special technologies like the Canon Image Stabilizer technology in select lenses helps to minimize the effect of camera shake, effectively adding up to four stops of light. With a dizzying array of lenses perfect for travel, sports, still life and everything in between, photographers can truly maximize the quality and performance of their EOS Rebel T2i with superlative Canon optics.SoftwareCanon EOS Digital Solution Disk (Version 22.0)The EOS Rebel T2i comes bundled with a Canon EOS Digital Solution Disk, which features powerful software programs designed to extend the EOS experience to the computer.

Each application is designed to perfect the captured images and streamline the digital workflow.Compatible Operating SystemWindows: Windows XP SP2 or SP3 / Windows Vista (all version except the Starter Edition) / Windows 7 32-bit and 64-bit versions. Macintosh: OS X 10.4 to 10.5EOS Utility (Version 2.8.0)for Macintosh or Windows handles the connection between the camera and computer whenever they're connected via USB. It allows remote controlled shooting from the computer, handles downloading of images from the camera to the computer, and allows seamless linking to either Canon's ZoomBrowser EX/ImageBrowser or Digital Photo Professional software once images have been copied to the hard drive. Furthermore, it's used to upload settings back into a USB-connected camera.Digital Photo Professional (Win/Mac, Version 3.8.0)is an image processing program that enables high-speed RAW image processing, high-speed previewing for real-time image adjustment and support for sRGB, Adobe RGB and Wide Gamut RGB color spaces. Because it's CMS (Color Management System) compatible, Digital Photo Professional allows for easy image layout and printing in Adobe RGB in conjunction with Easy-PhotoPrint and PictBridge printers. It also features the Dust Delete Data Detection tool for cleaner images.Picture Style Editor (Win/Mac, Version 1.7.0)Canon's Picture Style Editor enables you to create custom Picture Style profiles that can be used to customize the appearance of JPEG and RAW images captured with EOS Digital SLR cameras. Picture Style files created with Picture Style Editor can be loaded into the EOS cameras that support Picture Style and may also be used when processing RAW images in Canon software applications Digital Photo Professional, ZoomBrowser EX (for Windows) and ImageBrowser (for Mac).ZoomBrowser EX (Version 6.5.0)for Windows and ImageBrowser (Version 6.5.0) for Mac OS X are the easy, user-friendly options for viewing and editing of JPEG and even RAW image files. Both allow viewing of numerous types of images including finished TIFF and BMP files. Both also have a variety of search options for finding images, allow re-naming of single images or batches of files, and offer a variety of options for printing without using a separate image-editing program.What's in the BoxEOS Rebel T2i BodyEF-S 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 IS LensEyecup Ef (Not shown)Wide Strap EW-100DBIIIUSB Interface Cable IFC-130UAV Cable AVC-DC400STBattery Pack LP-E8Battery Charger LC-E8EOS Digital Solution Disk and Instruction Manuals""Great Photography is Easy"" Booklet and ""Do More with Macro"" Booklet (not shown)",7102,2301

The 2TB model weighs in on my scale at a hair over 1lb.Out of the box, plugged into my 2012 iMac (running Mavericks), the drive was picked up instantly, running by default in RAID 0 configuration (HFS, journaled). This is the least safe method of data preservation, but certainly the fastest available for this device. Much like the Western Digital My Book Thunderbolt Duo for desktops, this device is using software for its RAID. There are positives and negatives for hardware vs software RAID implementations, and I won't delve into this too much here. Apple's basic RAID software included in OS X isn't exactly stellar, though. (I prefer using SoftRAID, which - while pricey - is just a brilliant piece of software for OS X).A couple of minor issues:1.) If you break the Thunderbolt cable, the whole device is useless, as the cable is integrated. Be careful to tuck the cable away into its holder when you're done.2.) There's a small fan in this enclosure, and I hope it's a long-lasting one, as - again - I don't see how you could replace it.3.) If you run a RAID 1 mirror array, if one drive fails you cannot simply replace it as you can on the Western Digital dual-drive desktop 3.5"" RAID enclosures. You'll have to copy the data off, send the drive in, and then wait for a replacement. Not exactly ideal... I tried to see if I could open it up, but even removing the four accessible screws - the enclosure didn't want to come apart.4.) It's not a cheap setup. Especially since it's not even using a hardware RAID implementation, I'm surprised it costs so much.5.) There's a small fan in this unit. Initially I had thought it was there as a fail-safe as it wasn't spinning, and I guess it really is there as a last resort. After about an hour of solid transfers to it from a slow, USB 2.0 drive, the fan kicked in. I seriously thought something was wrong with it. It makes this high-pitched, absolutely obnoxious noise. Thankfully, after about 5 minutes of running it turns off, but it will come on again if there's continual heat (i.e. continual transfers). If this is going to be a high-use device with a lot of transferring data from/to it, - if noise bothers you, AVOID this drive. The fan is ghastly.Overall, though, this is a solid twin-drive setup, backed by Western Digital for 3 years. If you need a fast, portable games/scratch disk, run this thing in RAID 0 for ~200MB/s read/writes. If you need data redundancy for photographic/video works, run this in RAID 1 for protection against a single drive failure (at about the speed of a single drive, ~110MB/s).

A2SYAQXJGRY3XE,B000VDCT3C,aznpoet,"[4, 5]","I purchased my copy from Adorama for the same price as the Amazon because they threw in free high quality UV filter and circular polarizer.  I waited a long time, hoping that Nikon would release a VR version of this lens, since it's been out since early 2008. In the meantime, I had been using Nikon 24-85mm f/3.5-4.5G VR as my primary walk about lens on a D800.  I also have an earlier version of 24-120mm, while serviceable on a DX body, was frankly dismal on D800.  Aside from some CA and distortion issues, for the price, 24-85mm lens is an excellent overall performer with truly useful VR feature.  However, I wanted a faster lens for indoor use without the flash and wanted the convenience of a zoom lens.  I also looked at the new Tamron 24-70mm f/2.8 lens with VC (vibration control) but when Nikon recently offered instant rebate on their lenses, I decided to get this one.This lens delivers everything promised on a pro lens: superb IQ with center and edge sharpness, open and stopped down, tough build quality, quick and accurate AF.

I waited a long time, hoping that Nikon would release a VR version of this lens, since it's been out since early 2008. In the meantime, I had been using Nikon 24-85mm f/3.5-4.5G VR as my primary walk about lens on a D800. I also have an earlier version of 24-120mm, while serviceable on a DX body, was frankly dismal on D800. Aside from some CA and distortion issues, for the price, 24-85mm lens is an excellent overall performer with truly useful VR feature. However, I wanted a faster lens for indoor use without the flash and wanted the convenience of a zoom lens. I also looked at the new Tamron 24-70mm f/2.8 lens with VC (vibration control) but when Nikon recently offered instant rebate on their lenses, I decided to get this one.This lens delivers everything promised on a pro lens: superb IQ with center and edge sharpness, open and stopped down, tough build quality, quick and accurate AF.

A2AY4YUOX2N1BQ,B002TPFNXS,Ciaran,"[1, 1]","You know, I'm not that old, but I remember when remotes were big clunky things with beautiful computer-beige bodies and the functions on a sticker that fell off so often it might as well have been marketed as removable. Of course, the culture of design changes almost as quickly as the technology that supports it - we have sleek (dare I say artistic?) computer cases, televisions that fade into the wall, and of course, control like the Apple remote. There's no doubt that this thing looks fantastic - I've always been in love with the anodized aluminum used by Apple, but there's something different about being able to palm it in remote form. I don't care if this thing was made by Apple or by Dell - it's a killer design.I have the updated version of this remote (the one with the indented menu button), and though it could be called overly simplistic, it really does almost everything you want it to do. I use several of these remotes on a daily basis- one attached to our Apple TV, and the other for my iMac. For bedroom use, I love that it only has seven buttons - there's no fumbling around in the dark trying to remember if menu is to the left of the red button or on the right of the subtitles key - when using the Apple remote you know exactly what you're doing at all times. Integration with Apple products is of course excellent - the remotes were designed to be complimentary and they truly are.The Apple Remote takes aCR2032 3 Volts Battery, easily accessed by twisting the cover on the back counter-clockwise. I was pleased to see they had updated the design from the white remotes - they were a PAIN to replace the batteries on. Speaking of batteries - one  year of use and I have yet to replace a battery. I have no idea what expected battery life is (seeing as it will vary greatly depending on use), but for normal every day use I am very pleased.So what's the caveat? It is simply NOT comfortable to hold in your hand. I mean, it's an experience and everything, but much like the iPad 2 and 3 and the iPhone from 4 onwards, Apple doesn't seem to be too concerned with the comfort of their edges. I know, I know, they LOOK fantastic, but so did the original iPad and they had rounder edges there. Either way, I don't hold this all day like I do my portable devices, but it's worth mentioning.I'm still rating this at five stars for sheer form and function, but I would not be disappointed to see a slight rounding of the edges. Highly recommended.- DOBrien",5.0,"Form and function meet, with one small caveat.",1371340800,"06 16, 2013","You know, I'm not that old, but I remember when remotes were big clunky things with beautiful computer-beige bodies and the functions on a sticker that fell off so often it might as well have been marketed as removable.

I was pleased to see they had updated the design from the white remotes - they were a PAIN to replace the batteries on. Speaking of batteries - one year of use and I have yet to replace a battery. I have no idea what expected battery life is (seeing as it will vary greatly depending on use), but for normal every day use I am very pleased.So what's the caveat? It is simply NOT comfortable to hold in your hand. I mean, it's an experience and everything, but much like the iPad 2 and 3 and the iPhone from 4 onwards, Apple doesn't seem to be too concerned with the comfort of their edges. I know, I know, they LOOK fantastic, but so did the original iPad and they had rounder edges there. Either way, I don't hold this all day like I do my portable devices, but it's worth mentioning.I'm still rating this at five stars for sheer form and function, but I would not be disappointed to see a slight rounding of the edges. Highly recommended.- DOBrien","Form and function meet, with one small caveat.",2013-06-16,"Apple Remote - Mac, iPod or iPhone (MC377LL/A)","The Apple Music System Remote Control gives you total command of your music, photos, videos, and DVDs from anywhere in the room.

ANTN61S4L7WG9,B00AR95ESC,Sukru Tikves,"[7, 11]","The PJ790V camera I'm testing is an update to the older PJ760V of the Sony's top of the consumer line. While it is an incremental update, it brings a very good package of features, and if you're planning to use a single camcorder on different occasions, this might be a very good choice.The main differences with the previous model are the external surround microphone (which reduces internal noise in recordings), and a better projector system (including a brighter light, and an HDMI input). However it still shares familiar the optics of the previous gen, and it is not a bad thing.I tested it in both outdoor, and indoor conditions. At all occasions it produced great quality results. Even when it had difficulty indoors, the camera offered sufficient manual controls for compensating with worse lighting. And of course for very low to no light situations, there is night vision (infrared) recording, at the cost of losing color, and a big drain on the battery.The image stabilizer handled vertical shakes very well. Sony has designed the entire optical system (including the sensor) with movable parts, and it easily compensates for regular shake of the hand. While it would not be perfect, you can actually use the camera while walking -- this should be the one of the first things you try with the camera, and it is very satisfying to see the anti-shake mechanism in actionThe additional features, like the GPS tagging, a large storage (96G), external USB and SD card support (for quick backups) will help with longer trips. The projector, while sounding like a questionable addon, is actually very good for quickly showing something to friends or family. And smile detection shoots automatic pictures while recording a crowd, which is very handy.The product comes as an almost complete package. The Carl-Ziess lens, 10-17x optical zoom, built in usb cable, bundled wind screen, HD lcd touchscreen, lower powered viewfinder, leaves almost nothing to be desired. But there is always a but...I had two issues with it that I should tell. First of all the bundled battery has a very low capacity. Sony's ownNP-FV100is a must for extended use without power, anda chargerwill help keeping spare batteries charged while the main one is in use. Of course, it's also possible to buy them much cheaply from 3rd party manufacturers (for example, I had good experience withWasabi Power products). The second thing lacking is the internal WiFi module. It already has an antenna for GPS, and most radio chips can handle both of them at the same time. However Sony will require buyinga separate Wi-Fi adapter.But except for these issues, I found everything I could look for in a camera (at least consumer ones). It's a very good recommendation, if you need to shoot high quality videos, in many different occasions (events, trips, picnics, talks, and even safaris).",5.0,Sony's Flagship Camera does not Disappoint,1366588800,"04 22, 2013","The PJ790V camera I'm testing is an update to the older PJ760V of the Sony's top of the consumer line.

A34UVV757IKPVB,B00IWQREMQ,justsomeguy,"[8, 8]","I am not an audiophile.  I have been content with my TV speakers for years.  I have never owned an audio receiver, and I have never owned any speakers for my television.  I have always liked the idea of a &#34;sound bar&#34;, as well as owning a subwoofer.  I love movies, so you'd think this would have been something I bought long ago.  I held off on it for a long time because I live in an apartment, and I never liked the idea of a subwoofer shaking my place and possibly upsetting the neighbors.  This device has a solution for that, which I will go into in a minute.First, set up is a breeze.  You literally do nothing - no waiting, no pairing.  Just plug it in.  Even the wireless subwoofer you just plug into a power outlet.  I'm told that the human brain cannot detect which direction low-frequency sounds are coming from, so I have this sitting across the room behind my couch.Second, there are many, many sound options.  There's a &#34;Movie&#34; mode, a &#34;Game&#34; mode.  Even a &#34;Sports&#34; mode.  Again, I'm not an audiophile, so I can't tell the difference.  What I CAN tell the difference on are two wonderful options; Voice and Night modes.  I am terrible at picking out people talking when there is other noises going on.  Crowded restaurants - forget it.  I have taken to reading lips - or at least watching people's lips when they speak - it helps so much.  But - this thing has a &#34;Voice&#34; button on the remote and has several options when you hit that button which amps up the vocals for whatever it is you're watching.  It's been a lifesaver for me!  The Night mode is also a life-saver; when it's dark out, I use the &#34;night&#34; mode and it kills the super-bass you get from that subwoofer.  Everything sounds great still, but now my couch won't shake when there's an explosion on TV!  I love that feature too.Third; I don't like the app.  I don't use it.  I don't get it.  Why is it every device out there thinks it needs an app?  My Blu-ray player has one, my little ipod speaker thing has one.  Who uses them?  It just kills my battery on my iphone.  And for a speaker - it just needs to crank out sound - that's it.  Who needs an app for that???Fourth; there are only 3 HDMI inputs.  The idea being, you plug your HDMI cable from your Blu-ray into the sound bar, then another cable to the TV.  Do you know how many HDMI devices I have?  5; Cable box, Blu-Ray player, Xbox 360, a Roku 2 box and that lame Chromecast thing.  Now, this device comes with one of those old-school &#34;light&#34; cables- remember when those were the wave of the future back in 1999?  Fiber-optic.  That's it.  Anyhow, my TV thankfully has an output for that cable - so anything on TV will play through the sound bar.  WITH a slight delay - I notice it all the time and it drives me batty.  So - I don't suggest using that but since I have 5 devices and only 3 inputs - what else can I do?Overall I like it very much.  The options to customize what you're hearing are excellent, and it looks awesome sitting under my TV.

This is especially convenient now that many phones, including Blackberries and Motorola RAZR phones, feature USB power connections.Unique, Efficient Design with Rotating Plug for Added VersatilityIts compact, lightweight, and efficient design means that you can easily slip this mini surge protector into your laptop bag or carry-on, and because Belkin knows that working on the road often means trying to plug in despite awkward outlet or furniture positioning, a 360-degree rotating plug with four locking positions makes it easy to use this device in tight spaces.About Belkin International, Inc.Belkin offers a diverse product mix that provides people with seamless electronics integration in their homes, cars, and on the go.

A303SNZ4AR7TDQ,B007Q7EG7I,SirStinky,"[0, 0]","This is an upgrade to replace an NZXT Source 210 (a great case) for a customer that wanted to add water cooling for their system and future upgradability.This is a big case, and the HAF in the name implies high airflow, and you get a lot of it with this box. I was surprised that it's a mid tower, as it's big enough to be a full tower. It's 22.5&#34;L x 9.9&#34; W x 20.9&#34; H, so it's pretty big. It weighs around 22 lbs. It's made mostly of plastic and sheet metal. The plastic and sheet metal aren't thin and flimsy, and seem very sturdy and well-made. The PSU is on the bottom where it should be. The front panel came off easily, and the knock-outs for the expansion bays came out without a hassle as well. Inside it's painted black with a textured finish that's durable and unlikely to chip or rub off. Same with the mesh panels, which are plastic and would resist denting. The hard drive trays are plastic, which is good. There are also dust filters that you can change.It includes a lot of features, but it should considering you pay for it. Included are 3 fans. You get a 200mm fans in the front behind the front panel in front of the hard drive bays, a 200mm fan on top under the removable dust cover, and a 140mm fan at the rear above the expansion slots. The front fan is clear and it has a red LED in it that's controlled from the front panel. You can put up to four 200mm fans in here, top, front, and on the side if you wanted to, or up to 9 smaller fans. There's ample room for mounting a water cooling system. The H100i radiator fit with tons of room to spare.The side front side access panel is latched so it comes off easy, but it's held on with thumbscrews also. The other side panel also comes off so you can access the back of the motherboard and route cables. There is plenty of room for cables and the passthroughs are covered with rubber grommets ti protect the cables. There are lots of passthroughs and they are placed conveniently. I did run into some issues with them though as some cables couldn't reach across the back of the motherboard to get to the ATX input for the CPU, and the two 8-pin PCIe connectors wouldn't reach the graphics card if I ran them from behind.You also get lots of expandability. There are three 5.25&#34; and one 2.5&#34; external bays for optical drives, fan controllers, USB hubs, or multi card readers. One is an X-Dock that's for 2.5&#34; hard drives that plug into a daughterboard. It has Molex power plug and two SATA connectors that get plugged into the motherboard and PSU. There are 6 hard drive trays for 2.5&#34; and 3.5&#34; hard drives or SSD's. They are quick release bays (which I like) that unlock and pull out easily. There aren't adapters for the 2.5&#34; drives in them though, but 3.5&#34; drives are held in by metal pins on rubber grommets so there's no screws needed. The front panel has three buttons, a power, reset, and one for the front fan's LED. There are also 2 USB 3.0 and 2.0 ports, audio in and out (supports digital audio). The power button and HDD activity are illuminated with red LED's. Out back there's an I/O for the main board, and an 8+1 expansion slots for expansion cards, so you can run 3-way SLI or CrossfireX no problem with the full-size graphics cards (18+ inches long with the HDD cage removed). The cut-outs are metal with vent cutouts, and are screwed in so you can reinstall them if you need to. On the top there's a removable cover that can house cans or a radiator. It's held on with a thumbscrew at the rear and slides off easily. There's also a rubber-lined tray on top for holding your phone, keys, change, or whatever else.Cooler Master makes some really great products, and this is no exception. Installing the motherboard was very easy, although the standoffs had a little trouble going in. It's marked for mATX, ATX, and E ATX boards. I had no issues with the Corsair H100i water cooler either. The fans and radiator went in no problem. Installing the SSD was easy, and routing the cables wasn't an exercise in futility as there was lots of passthroughs and they were large enough. The bottom PSU also has a sliding cover to conceal cables as well. Nice touch. The fans were very quiet when running as well.What I like:Sturdy and well-madeGood lookingLots of expandabilityExcellent airflow capabilities with tons of fan mountsLots of cable passthroughs with rubber grommetsQuick release HDD traysDust filtersIncludes two 200mm and one 140mm quiet fansFront USB 3.0Quick release side panel and top coverWhat I don't like:Huge for a mid-towerHeavyQuick release panel is screwed on with thumbscrewsButtons felt cheapExpensiveWould have liked to see the front panel connectors in a single plug like on other high-end casesOverall this is a great box.

Unfortunately my video cards generated too much heat inside the case, and I decided it would be better to split them into 2 systems. Now my sytem is super quiet, efficient and has plenty of GPU power to run whatever I want.Here are some facts you need to know when picking out equipment for a build.1) Never exceed 400 watts of (video cards) power, which translates directly into heat produced, in an enclosed case with air cooling. Your main PCIE16 card will be hotter because of radiant heat from the second card. This will make card 1 throttle more to control the heat, which will equal bad performance.

Reference ""hamster fans"" are extremey loud and sound like a hair dryer running, I do not recomended them.2) It is fine to overkill your Power supply! Honestly you should double the wattage of the PS to what you think you will use. It allows for growth and overclocking if you want.  Power Supplies run most efficiently at 50% of thier rated wattage and once you hit 70% efficiency goes down fast, while heat increases.3) One 24vdc rail is the best, and most versatile for multiple video card setups because you do not waist power.4) Fully Modular is the ONLY way to go5) Spend the extra money on a GOLD standard power supply, you will have a super stable and reliable system because you did.6) NEVER use power supply cables from ANOTHER power supply, because they can be wired different at the PS.

It's easy to spend less than $100 or more than $500 for what may appear to be, at least outwardly, comparable models. While they may look the same, they are probably quite different on the inside.Recently, the binocular market has seen a flood of giant binoculars at prices that were unheard of just a few years ago. In general, giant binoculars are defined as those that magnify the view 10 times or more and have 70-mm or larger front (objective) lenses. It used to be that the least expensive giant binoculars cost in excess of $150, even $200. All that changed not long ago, when the bottom fell out of the price cellar. Now, several companies import giant binoculars that sell for half that, or less.Celestron's 15x70 SkyMaster binoculars are one of the leaders in the low-price giant binocular arena. They certainly sound good on paper. The SkyMasters include multicoated optics and BaK-4 internal prisms, two features that promise brighter, better images, and key points to look for when judging a pair of binoculars. They also come with an adapter for attaching them to a photo tripod, which is a must to use them to their fullest, and a soft carrying case. But just because they are cheap doesn't always mean they are worth the price. Would it be better to save up for a more expensive pair?To find the answer, I had an opportunity recently to judge the SkyMasters against a pair ofFujinon 16x70 FMT-SX binoculars, one of the finest pairs of giant binoculars sold today. Like the SkyMasters, the Fujinons feature BaK-4 prisms, but also have fully multicoated optics. As a general rule, superior coatings mean superior image sharpness and contrast. But then, that should be expected, given that the Fujinons cost many times more than the Celestrons.While the Fujinons were clearly the better performer, the Celestron SkyMasters held up admirably. Image brightness, quality, and contrast were all remarkable considering their bargain price. Although images were a little soft across the outer 25% of the Celestron's field, the overall view was impressive nonetheless.Some inexpensive binoculars have very sloppy focusing, causing the eyepieces to tilt and shift. Not so with the SkyMasters. I found that their center-focusing mechanism worked smoothly, with no apparently backlash or wobble. Eye relief (the distance you hold your eyes away from the eyepieces to see the full field) is stated to be 18 mm, a good distance for higher power binoculars and an important consideration if you must wear glasses when viewing. The SkyMasters are also light enough to support by hand for short periods of time, although buyers would be well advised to mount them on a sturdy photo tripod.The bottom line is, if you are considering a pair of giant binoculars, whether for bird watching, stargazing, or another recreational use, and have a limited budget, Celestron's giant 15x70 SkyMasters represent an excellent value. --Phil Harrington, author ofStar WareandStar WatchPros:Exceptional value for the priceLight enough to support by handBaK-4 prismsMulticoated opticsCons:Outer 25% of the field is soft and a little blurryRequires a tripod to use for extended periods",64.0,Celestron,Camera & Photo,Binoculars & Scopes,Amazon,2012,12,3,4733,0.8910015060240963,0,0,0.0,285,0.009364349293537607,2.107023261970153,4.0,1.4142135623730951,2,2,4.0,1.2792042981336624,23,23,"Celestron SkyMaster Giant 15x70 Binoculars with Tripod Adapter Binoculars come in a wide range of shapes and sizes these days, and an even wider range of prices.

I have also noticed that when in Netflix and using the search function, the results shown don't always match what is selected in the scroll of listed programs. Sometimes Netflix will freeze up too.  Other things include slow start up time, it takes about 35-40 sec to bring screen up, slow response to remote inputs, sometime you'll press the button 2 or 3 times (because you think the unit didn't receive that command) before the unit responds, causing the unit to jump pass the selection you're trying to make.

Since Amazon clumps them all together, this review is about those 3 items.Being an average user with remotes, flashlights, toys, game controllers, I've gone through hundreds of akaline batteries. I've even upgraded to use those Lithium branded ones that Energizer and Duracell sells, but those things carry a premium price (like $20 for a pack of 4). Over my life, I've probably spent thousands of dollars on disposable batteries. Tired of spending money on disposables, a couple years ago I bought one of those Duracell rechargeable battery kits from Walmart. It came with a 4-battery wall charger and 4 2000mAh batteries (made in China). Over time, those four batteries held up their end (I used them in my digital camera) but 2 of those batteries never kept their charge for long and I ended up throwing them away. I still have the other two and they work ""OK"".Recently about a year or so ago, I needed some more batteries and I only had 4 rechargeables from my original Durcell kit. I ended up buying a 4-pack of Duracell Rechargeable 2450mAh (made in Japan) and an even newer 4-pack of Duracell Rechargeable 2650mAh (made in Japan). Those worked pretty good but because of the number of devices I have requiring batteries, I needed to invest more in batteries... but I wasn't about to until I did more research on what were the best because my past rechargeable battery experiences were either a hit or miss.From my research (just Google for best rechargeable batteries) I learned that the best rechargeable batteries come from Japan (the China ones are OK) and Duracell actually sometimes rebrands batteries made by Sanyo (their Eneloop line). Now I know why my Chinese Duracells never lasted quite as long as my Japanese Duracells! I also learned that the wall charger (most of them that come with rechargeable batteries these days) I got with my kit do not charge batteries properly and is one of the reasons why all my batteries don't seem to last as long as they did when I first bought them.In addition, I found a great resource on Amazon, ""NLee the Engineer"" who knows his stuff about batteries & chargers (he's an electrical engineer). Based on his FAQs & reviews, I made my choice for a good charger & rechargeable batteries by his recommendation. So in one swoop, I invested in an intelligent battery charger (Maha C9000) and a handful of Sanyo Eneloop batteries (over $100 worth).Upon receiving the batteries, I verified that they were indeed the *latest* generation of Sanyo Eneloops (they have a grayish-silver crown logo on the side of them). While there is very little difference between the prior generation and the latest, the latest ones are slightly better and if I'm going to drop over $100 on batteries, I want to make sure I got the best & latest.The Eneloop packaging & several review sites stated that the Sanyo Eneloops are top rated because they have 1) a high durability, allowing estimated 1500 charges and 2) low self-discharge rate, maintains a large percentage of its charge after 3 years. While I can't attest to either because I only had them for a short period of time, I can say that they are very good when I used them in conjunction with my Maha C9000 charger. They power everything I have without issues (I had some weird issues with other types not powering up some devices).One thing I will say to be aware of is that the white Eneloops are rated at 2000 mAH. Other brands do boast a higher mAH and the higher the mAH, the more ""juice"" you have for your devices. Some people consider 2000 mAH to be a little low for some high powered devices. My Duracells (~$14), which I'm fairly certain are rebranded Eneloops, have a similar rating to that of the Eneloop XX brand (Sanyo XX Battery Powered by eneloop, 2500mAh typical / 2400 mAh minimum High Capacity, 4 Pack AA Ni-MH Pre-Charged Rechargeable Batteries)) and last nearly as long as the XXs.So the question you have to ask yourself is, if you need higher capacity, do you take a gamble on a brand that could potentially not be an Eneloop or just pay the $7 difference and get the XX Eneloops that are guaranteed at 2500mAh? Either way, I'm very satisfied with my purchase and have no complaints whatsoever about the Eneloops.

When looking at the Moon through a telescope, bright reflected sunlight can produce significant glare. The Moon's disk, even at partial phases, is in fact so intensely bright with reflected sunlight that observing surface details can be challenging due to the overwhelming glare. This glare can be so bright that it washes out most of the interesting lunar features such as craters, rilles, mountains, and valleys. The considerable brightness also reduces contrast on our nearest neighbor in the solar system. To improve contrast and tone down glare easily, we recommend using a neutral-density 1.25 inch Orion 13 percent Transmission Moon Filter. This inexpensive accessory threads directly into a 1.25 inch eyepiece barrel and blocks 87 percent of the light gathered by the telescope, making for more comfortable lunar views exhibiting higher contrast. Once installed on a 1.25 inch telescope eyepiece, the Orion 13 percent Transmission Moon Filter will bring out considerably more lunar surface details thanks to the boosted contrast. Not only will more surface features and details pop out, but you can study them in greater comfort, thanks to Moon Filter reducing overall brightness without altering color. This neutral-density telescope eyepiece filter reduces irradiation, which is the distortion at the boundary between light and dark areas, such as along the lunar terminator. Using a Moon filter also helps conserve dark-adapted vision while viewing the lunar surface, especially when using big telescopes with 6 inches of aperture and larger.

AEJAGHLC675A7,B001QTXKB0,John Williamson,"[2, 2]","Sometimes you have to read beyond the title before choosing a product. It's always best to carefully read the product description, and perhaps delve into some of the product reviews, both the positive and negative ones, before making your choice. Such is the case with this one:Et&oacute;n FR160R Microlink Self-Powered AM/FM/NOAA Weather Radio with Flashlight, Solar Power and Cell Phone ChargerPicking the title apart, it is a self-powered AM/FM/NOAA weather radio, and depending on location, offers decent reception. It's a good basic flashlight, and it is solar-powered, but as a cell phone charger, don't expect miracles. Here's a quick breakdown for those who want just the subjective good and not so good points.Pros:+ AM & FM bands plus NOAA weatherband (all 7 channels); excellent for emergencies+ Good emergency flashlight; 3 white LEDs provide reasonable light+ Two power sources; built-in solar cells or crank generator+ Internal Ni-MH rechargeable battery; can be replaced if needed+ Standard 3.5 mm headphone jack; rubber cap prevents environmental damage+ Small rubber feet on base; keeps it from sliding around+ Compact size; 5 x 2 x 1 inches, weighs 8 ouncesCons:- Inadequate as a cell phone charger for contemporary smartphones- No AC charger available; needs an additional method of chargingIn Use:Ever since Hurricane Sandy slammed into the New York region in October 2012, I've been upgrading my emergency supplies. Some of us were without power for five days, others longer, and though I was relatively well prepared for this costly disaster, products like this can do nothing but help.First thing that should be mentioned is that this full-featured emergency radio is amazingly small. Reading its approximate dimensions of 5"" wide x 2"" high x 1"" deep can be misleading, so imagine it placed on its side on top of a dollar bill: it's actually smaller than US paper currency (which measure 2.61 inches wide and 6.14 inches long), that's just one of the things that make this small radio so appealing. It also weighs just over half a pound, so it's jacket pocketable in an emergency.The radio's tuner pulls in both AM and FM stations, and with surprisingly clear reception. Tested this in both in Pennsylvania and in the New York City areas. It receives all seven NOAA bands using the slide selector on the radio panel, so you can monitor changing weather conditions during emergency conditions.You can charge the FR160 in less than two minutes using its hand crank. Using the crank to charge it will give you radio reception at low volume for about 15 to 20 minutes. Crank for a longer period and it will play longer. You can also place it in sunlight (even on an overcast day, as I found out) and its built-in solar panel handily powers the radio and recharges its battery pack. If you're looking for audio attributes on the level of Bose, JBL or Polk Audio speakers, this radio isn't for you... but the sound quality of this small radio is quite good considering its size. Listened to a favorite ""smooth jazz"" station for awhile, switched to classical then to '80s rock, and was quite pleased all around. The NOAA weatherband with its robotized constant announcements was good, and as clear as one could expect.It has a flashlight with three LEDs on its end, providing decently bright illumination. For comparison it's about on the same level as myGarrity Power Lite 3 LED Crank Light. This model is also brighter than some of the predecessors from Eton.However...Getting back to product titles and descriptions, forget anything stellar if you think that this would be a good product for cell phone charging. Its output is inadequate for contemporary smartphones such as the iPhones or Samsung Galaxy android phones, unless you want to put its cranking action as part of a daily fitness routine. Simply put, you'll get your workout cranking away and then find that you only have a couple of minutes of charge. If your cell phone has the option of spare batteries, get them. There's also no AC wall charger available for this model, so let it charge itself in a window.If smartphone charging is a personal imperative, then you might want to look into the AC poweredEton BoostBloc 2000mAh Portable Backup Battery Pack-Charger for Smart Phonesor one of the other variations available here.

It's always best to carefully read the product description, and perhaps delve into some of the product reviews, both the positive and negative ones, before making your choice. Such is the case with this one:Etón FR160R Microlink Self-Powered AM/FM/NOAA Weather Radio with Flashlight, Solar Power and Cell Phone ChargerPicking the title apart, it is a self-powered AM/FM/NOAA weather radio, and depending on location, offers decent reception. It's a good basic flashlight, and it is solar-powered, but as a cell phone charger, don't expect miracles. Here's a quick breakdown for those who want just the subjective good and not so good points.Pros:+ AM & FM bands plus NOAA weatherband (all 7 channels); excellent for emergencies+ Good emergency flashlight; 3 white LEDs provide reasonable light+ Two power sources; built-in solar cells or crank generator+ Internal Ni-MH rechargeable battery; can be replaced if needed+ Standard 3.5 mm headphone jack; rubber cap prevents environmental damage+ Small rubber feet on base; keeps it from sliding around+ Compact size; 5 x 2 x 1 inches, weighs 8 ouncesCons:- Inadequate as a cell phone charger for contemporary smartphones- No AC charger available; needs an additional method of chargingIn Use:Ever since Hurricane Sandy slammed into the New York region in October 2012, I've been upgrading my emergency supplies. Some of us were without power for five days, others longer, and though I was relatively well prepared for this costly disaster, products like this can do nothing but help.First thing that should be mentioned is that this full-featured emergency radio is amazingly small. Reading its approximate dimensions of 5"" wide x 2"" high x 1"" deep can be misleading, so imagine it placed on its side on top of a dollar bill: it's actually smaller than US paper currency (which measure 2.61 inches wide and 6.14 inches long), that's just one of the things that make this small radio so appealing. It also weighs just over half a pound, so it's jacket pocketable in an emergency.The radio's tuner pulls in both AM and FM stations, and with surprisingly clear reception. Tested this in both in Pennsylvania and in the New York City areas. It receives all seven NOAA bands using the slide selector on the radio panel, so you can monitor changing weather conditions during emergency conditions.You can charge the FR160 in less than two minutes using its hand crank. Using the crank to charge it will give you radio reception at low volume for about 15 to 20 minutes. Crank for a longer period and it will play longer. You can also place it in sunlight (even on an overcast day, as I found out) and its built-in solar panel handily powers the radio and recharges its battery pack. If you're looking for audio attributes on the level of Bose, JBL or Polk Audio speakers, this radio isn't for you... but the sound quality of this small radio is quite good considering its size. Listened to a favorite ""smooth jazz"" station for awhile, switched to classical then to '80s rock, and was quite pleased all around. The NOAA weatherband with its robotized constant announcements was good, and as clear as one could expect.It has a flashlight with three LEDs on its end, providing decently bright illumination. For comparison it's about on the same level as myGarrity Power Lite 3 LED Crank Light. This model is also brighter than some of the predecessors from Eton.However...Getting back to product titles and descriptions, forget anything stellar if you think that this would be a good product for cell phone charging. Its output is inadequate for contemporary smartphones such as the iPhones or Samsung Galaxy android phones, unless you want to put its cranking action as part of a daily fitness routine. Simply put, you'll get your workout cranking away and then find that you only have a couple of minutes of charge. If your cell phone has the option of spare batteries, get them. There's also no AC wall charger available for this model, so let it charge itself in a window.If smartphone charging is a personal imperative, then you might want to look into the AC poweredEton BoostBloc 2000mAh Portable Backup Battery Pack-Charger for Smart Phonesor one of the other variations available here.

A1K1HNG1TLL7AR,B00F0DD0I6,VIPbeachBum,"[1, 2]","This is by far the very best router I have ever had based on speed. There is very negligible speed/signal loss compared to my former combo Motorola SBG6850 modem/wireless router. The old SBG6850 was getting 56mbps at the wired Ethernet port on the router and anywhere from 10-30mbps on the wireless side. The speed loss was massive compared to the AC1900 router.It was easy to set up with TWC and the SB6141. The Netgear genie setup wizard did not see the modem on setup. Had to go to the browser and log into the modem to see what it's known MAC address was and manually enter it into the AC1900. The router wizard ended up asking me for the modems MAC address anyway so it was a pretty fool proof installation. Maybe took a whole twenty  minutes to install it, upgrade the firmware and finally connect to the internet. Fast and easy compared to any of the routers I have installed over the years. They are so much easier now to configure that it's almost plug and play.Now getting 56mbps on the wired side and 54mbps wireless down the hall in another room. It's like the wireless stuff in my house is now wired.

There is very negligible speed/signal loss compared to my former combo Motorola SBG6850 modem/wireless router. The old SBG6850 was getting 56mbps at the wired Ethernet port on the router and anywhere from 10-30mbps on the wireless side. The speed loss was massive compared to the AC1900 router.It was easy to set up with TWC and the SB6141. The Netgear genie setup wizard did not see the modem on setup. Had to go to the browser and log into the modem to see what it's known MAC address was and manually enter it into the AC1900. The router wizard ended up asking me for the modems MAC address anyway so it was a pretty fool proof installation. Maybe took a whole twenty minutes to install it, upgrade the firmware and finally connect to the internet. Fast and easy compared to any of the routers I have installed over the years. They are so much easier now to configure that it's almost plug and play.Now getting 56mbps on the wired side and 54mbps wireless down the hall in another room.

It's a good monitor overall and it has a good selection of inputs.  My usage is primarily browsing the web, writing, and watching videos.  I was pretty excited to give the HP Envy 23-inch LED monitor a try because of its IPS panel.  While I liked the display, I was rather disappointed by the lack of a couple of features: a DVI input and VESA support for mounting.DISPLAYMost monitor guides will tell you that IPS panels are the most expensive and they're known to have good color accuracy and significantly better viewing angles than other types of panels.  Compared to my ASUS, I did actually prefer the screen of the HP Envy.  I'm not a graphics pro, so I may not recognize subtle differences, but I spent a lot of time trying to make the two panels look as similar as possible.  And in the end, my eyes just preferred the HP Envy.  Text looked great while browsing the web and writing emails, my pictures looked nice, and movies looked fine.  I actually enjoyed the movie watching more on the Envy, probably because of the glossy display.  My ASUS has a matte screen.CONTROLS & STANDThe controls and menu for the HP Envy are pretty decent and not too difficult to figure out.  The buttons are much more responsive than the ones on my ASUS.  The stand is easy to attach and looks nice.  Unfortunately, the only adjustment you can make is a front tilt.  On my desk, the Envy is a good one to two inches too low for ergonomic viewing.  Being able to raise it would've been a wonderful feature, but most monitors come with annoyingly bad stands and the HP Envy monitor is no different.  My ASUS also came with a poor stand, but I made up for it by mounting it on an articulating monitor arm.  I would have done the same with the HP Envy, but it lacks VESA support for mounting -- ARGH.  I really would have replaced my ASUS with the HP Envy, but if I can't adjust its height without getting a monitor riser, it's a no-go for me.  Such a shame.CONNECTIONSThe HP Envy touts connectivity, but it has just one VGA and two HDMI inputs.  To keep the panel inexpensive, HP left out a DVI input.  On the plus side, it did come with both VGA and HDMI cables.  After plugging the HDMI cable in to my PC, I noticed my desktop didn't fill the screen, so I had about a half inch black border on every side.  Text was also very blurry.  I eventually figured out that my AMD Radeon graphics software was underscanning the display for some reason.

A1E1LEVQ9VQNK,B00G4UQ6U8,J. Chambers,"[2, 2]","After using the Brainwavz S1 earphones for a few days, they may be my favorite wired earphones. Okay, they're not Bluetooth, which gives you the freedom to move around at a distance from the audio source, as well as controlling a playlist and sound volume remotely. But wired earphones have been around for a long time and have served a good purpose, so I'm judging the Brainwavz S1 unit primarily on audio quality and comfort.About the audio quality: I'm not a dedicated audiophile, and I don't know all the technical terms for describing the quality of the sound, but to my ears, the music that pumped out of the earphones sounded terrific, as good or better than any earphones I've used. The bass was remarkably good for the tiny earphones, and the clarity of the lyrics was excellent.And the earphones were very comfortable.

I prefer a 10"" screen because my eyesight isn't the greatest.  I do not find that a 10"" tablet is too cumbersome to carry.  This Sony featherweight tablet makes it even less so.The Sony Xperia Z is an Android based tablet.  Its stand-out features are (1) it is featherweight, (2) it is waterproof, and (3) it can function as your remote control.  The Xperia Z's competition is the Nexus 10.  Other 10"" tablets are the iPad 4 and Surface RT (iPad 5 is not out yet & the Surface Pro is more laptop than tablet, IMO).The Sony Xperia Z has a rich, vibrant screen.  It has a wide 1"" bezel and the actual screen size is 10"".  It has a rubberized, soft touch back, a rear & front facing camera, 2 speakers, a SD card slot & the ability to insert a micro USB (but the slot also used for charging).  The screen is nicely touch sensitive & Sony gives you the ability to customize your five start screens.  Tablet status information is in the bottom right corner, so you always know how much battery life, wifi status, and time.  On the bottom left corner is page back, hom, and list view.  Bottom middle are quick view of selected apps and the remote control app.The Xperia is not without its annoyances:1. While it is wonderful that the tablet is waterproof, the openings are a little difficult to open & I have a tendency to want to pull at the speaker rather than the slot hinge.2.  The USB slot is a micro USB slot & is also used for charging.3. As a non-Android user, I would prefer to have all of my preferences on my 1st start screen rather than scrolling through 5 start screens.4. So far, no great covers for the tablet & no covers that also have keypads.5. The screen doesn't change from portrait to landscape with you.6. It is more of an entertainment device than a business use device.  The office suites app is mediocre.7. The back is rubberized plastic, not metal, so I wonder about the durability.Overall, even though I am not a current Android user & had to teach myself how to navigate the Sony Xperia Z, I really like it.  It has a nice, vibrant screen, decent sound, decent front/back cameras (not good enough to swap out my real camera), easily connects to wifi & is super light.

A30SZ5HVLKTN45,B0071LSAR6,RC,"[42, 46]","A passable stereo for the money.  It plays MP3s off of SD and USB pretty well, if you don't mind that it cuts off the first half-second of each file (which is pretty jarring if your MP3s don't have a lot of silence at the beginning).It at least saves your position, playback continues where you left off, automatically.  The controls it has are as good as you could expect for a simple car stereo (about the same as a good CD player) but no comparison to the full-featured in-dash screens with scroll wheels and an array of on-screen options.  Fast forward and rewind are responsive, and work as they should, as does jump forward/back, skip +10/-10 songs, random play, etc., which isn't always the case for cheap MP3 players.  There was clearly some thought put into user-friendly operation.  When the SD or USB card isn't inserted, it will skip over those options as you change the ""mode"".  And when you plug-in an SD or USB drive, it automatically opens it and starts playing.  And it's never been unresponsive to input...  All the buttons work quickly, no matter what mode you're in, or what the player is doing.The (amplifier) sound quality isn't impressive, but for this price, it's probably only slightly worse than you'd expect...  Better than cheap amplified computer speakers, and good enough not to matter in a fairly noisy car.  But you'll notice your music just doesn't sound right.  Particularly with AUX input, you should expect substantial noise and distortion, but while you're moving, the road noise partially masks it.I'm not bothered by the LCD brightness...  It's not very bright, but it's visible, even in sunlight, while viewed through sunglasses.  Yeah, the clock won't stay up there for long, but hitting the button works fine, and automatically switching back to the song/station info is more user-friendly, and definitely the way I prefer it to work.  The LCD EQ even looks nice.FM reception isn't very good.  Only the booming local stations are coming through well enough to listen to.  Any station that doesn't overload a decent radio is hard to hear on this thing, behind a wall of static, or just fading in and out enough that it's unlistenable.  I've tried swapping antenna connectors and such without any luck.  Since others have complained about reception as well, I don't believe it's just me.  I found the Local/DX option, but toggling it does NOTHING, but I leave it set on DX.  The scan up/down is very sensitive, and AMS does its job, auto-programming all the available stations to the preset buttons, but that's cold comfort with such poor FM radio reception.  If you want a radio, none of these cheap no-name units does the job.  You're just going to have to spend twice as much for a name-brand car stereo (JVC/Pioneer/etc.).But my biggest complaint is that the USB port is useless for charging a phone...  It was GREAT having a USB cord dangling from my dash, ready to go all the time... not having to hassle with $2 cigarette lighter chargers constantly.  That is, until I noticed my phone wasn't charging at all.  This stereo is putting out a steady 5V on the USB port, but as such a low current that my phone gets drained, rather than charging at all.  This while the charging light is on, fooling you into thinking it's doing something.  Since even a $2 cigarette lighter adapter can do a decent job of charging, and this $30 stereo can't, this is pretty inexcusable, and a huge missed opportunity, which could and should have been a killer feature.It works well enough as an MP3 player that I'm not going to send it back, even as disappointed as I am with the AUX input sound quality, zero-power USB port, and the terrible radio reception.

I was EXTREMELY wary of the recall EVGA had back in October 2013, but it seems like a manufacturer with this kind of reputation and experience would know how to run a recall, and would also be d*mned sure they got it right the second time around.  I know a warranty won't cover my equipment and data, but the 10 year warranty (which I'm sure I'll be using in about 8 years) from a company that probably won't be going anywhere (since they're one of the top mobo and vid cards manufacturers) clinched the deal.The PSU comes in a custom tailored cloth bag... meant to make you think of it like jewels, I assume.The physical unit is built solid as a rock with a nice, big, quiet fan (I definitely can't hear it over any of the other stuff in the case, especially the vid card).  The exterior is covered with a sort of ""hammered"" finish that makes it look like a truck bed.The *fully* modular design is AWESOME. Also, the connectors (where the cables plug into the unit) are appropriately sized, unlike the KingWin plugs which are so HUGE (to refract the ridiculously gimmicky LED's I assume) that you can't thread them through your case.The EVGA PSU shipped with 1x24 ATX cable, 2x 4+4 pin EPS 12v CPU, 4x 6+2 pin PCI-E VGA, 2x 6+6+2 pin PCI-E VGA, (4) 3xSata, (1) 3x molex, (1) 2x molex + 4 pin floppy (?), and the power cord.  There is a large nylon case to store the extra cables (I used all the SATA and molex, but even with dual vid cards and some other stuff, who could possibly use all those PCI-E cables?! --nice to have them though).  They even throw in a bag of velcro ties to wrangle the cables.  Very nice.  If I have any complaints it's that the sata connectors are a little close together on the cable (if your sata devices aren't *right* next to each other, you'll have issues).  I only have one sata connector left available, and no molex left over, so I guess it'd be nice to have a couple more sata/molex cables. [UPDATE] I actually had a full extra run of Sata (not just a single connection) that I overlooked, so there are actually 4 available sata connectors left in my machine.  I recently purchased a USB 3.0 PCIe card that requires power via molex, so I guess I'll have to purchase a sata to molex adapter considering I am out of molex connectors that came with the unit.So far so good, but I'll definitely be holding onto the box, because there's no way something like this will last 10 years, and I definitely plan on taking them up on the warranty!FWIW, every PSU manufacturer, no matter how great, has some bad reviews.

The solution for me was a Digital Video Recorder (DVR).I bought this hard drive in combination with aSabrent USB 3.0 SATA 3.5-Inch Aluminum Hard Drive Enclosure (EC-GD35), so I could use it with the Dish-TV VIP211K satellite receiver in my motorhome.  The combination of those two items from Amazon ($87.18) cost between $10 and $50 less than similar offerings on Dish-TV's Website.  According to Dish-TV, a 1TB hard drive will record 120 hours of video, but they don't say if it'll record that many hours in HD.Installing this hard drive into the Sabrent enclosure took no more than three minutes, which I felt was time well-spent considering what I saved.  After I plugged this ""enclosed"" hard drive into the satellite receiver's USB port, turned it on and had Dish-TV activate the hard drive, which costs $40, it took about five minutes to format.

A3SL0HA6422W4M,B000065BPB,Dale Thorn,"[1, 1]","Sources: iPhone4 alone, iPhone4 with PA2V2 using LOD, various computers using Audioengine D1 DAC and the D1's headphone out.First impression: Very lean bass, slightly hollow mids, strong treble. The very lean bass became less lean after giving the earpads some time to develop a better seal. Based on prior experience with low-cost plastic earpads similar to the HD-280's, I think these earpads will always need a minute or two to get the best bass seal possible. If I can find replacement earpads that are covered with a better quality material, it might improve the upper bass and lower midrange, if it doesn't boost the lower bass too much.Running some sweep frequency tones, I note that the HD-280 is recessed somewhat from the upper bass through 200 hz or so, which makes the sound above 300 hz seem emphasized and contributes to the impression of a slight hollowness on first listen. The sensation of hollowness goes away pretty quickly, but male voices may seem slightly distant or weak in some cases. Another side effect of the recessed upper bass is when listening to a lot of tracks I'm familiar with, the lower bass seems to hit a lot harder. Moving up past the mids to the treble, I don't find anything remarkable until I get to about 7 khz, where the output seems stronger than average. I also hear some emphasis around 9 khz, and I suspect that the strong output at these frequencies may be a contributor to the slightly &#34;zingy&#34; or &#34;tizzy&#34; treble on some tracks. Despite the fairly strong treble, sibilants and other treble harshness seem to be less of a problem than what's average for my other hi-fi headphones with strong treble.The HD-280 very nearly qualifies as portable by my standards, i.e. being able to wear a headphone around my neck all day when not in use. But even though the earcups pull down just far enough and fold flat on my chest, the feeling is claustrophobic there, and the long, heavy, non-detachable coiled cable is the negative deciding factor. The earpads aren't especially soft, and are covered in a very low-cost plastic. The pads are circumaural (around the ear) and are large enough to not touch my ears. I think a person would have to have very large ears to feel cramped by the HD-280's earpads. The clamping force is very strong, unusually so, and until a person gets accustomed to it they might experience a headache or two. In fact, if an HD-280 user does get used to the clamping force, the long-term comfort should be good since there are no other issues with pinching or lack of flexibility in getting a good fit. After using Beyer's DT-48 headphones, getting used to the HD-280 was no problem for me.The HD-280 feels light for a full-size headphone, and appears to be all plastic. The cable is terminated in a standard 3.5 mm miniplug with threads for a screw-on 6.35 mm adapter (included in the packaging). Nothing else is supplied. In spite of the HD-280's low price and plastic build, the appearance is decent, the earpads, headband, and cable are replaceable, and the overall sound quality is very good given the slight de-emphasis of the upper bass and lower midrange as noted above. In other reviews I've done I've included the following music examples with comments about how the headphones sound with each track. My suggestion is instead of reading each one as an absolute unto itself, you could compare my notes here to other reviews and see how the HD-280 compares with each individual track.Bauhaus - Bela Lugosi's Dead (~1980): Strong midrange sound effects - this is a good worst-case test for resonant-type sounds in the most sensitive midrange area. Handled very well by the HD-280.Beethoven Symphony 9, Solti/CSO (1972): Very good overall sound. Of special note for this headphone are the bass impacts beginning around 10:30 of the fourth movement. Those impacts are unusually strong with the HD-280.Blues Project - Caress Me Baby (1966): Rarely mentioned, but one of the greatest white blues recordings ever. The loud piercing guitar sound at 0:41 into the track is a good test for distortion or other problems. Handled very well here.Boz Scaggs - Lowdown (1976): Good sound quality - this is a great test for any nasality in the midrange. Handled well by the HD-280.Buffalo Springfield - Kind Woman (~1968): A Richie Furay song entirely, rarely mentioned, but one of the best sounding rock ballads ever. This will sound good on most headphones, and it sounds very good with the HD-280.Cat Stevens - Morning Has Broken (early 70's): A near-perfect test for overall sound - this track will separate the best sounding headphones from the lesser quality types. Nothing specific, except that almost any deviation from perfect reproduction will stand out with this track. Sounds very good on the HD-280.Catherine Wheel - Black Metallic (~1991): Goth with industrial overtones - I like this since it's a great music composition and the sound effects are smoothly integrated into the mix. This may sound distorted or mushy with some headphones, but the HD-280 renders the deliberate instrumental distortions clearly.Def Leppard - Bringin' On The Heartbreak (1981): MTV goth/pop/metal at its best - good ambience and high energy - the better headphones will separate the details and make for a good experience. Lesser quality and the details tend to mush together. The HD-280 plays this very well.J.S. Bach - E. Power Biggs Plays Bach in the Thomaskirche (~1970): Recorded on a tracker organ in East Germany, the tracks on this recording have the authentic baroque sound that Bach composed for, albeit the bellows are operated by motor today. The HD-280 plays the tones seamlessly through the upper limits of the organ, which cover nearly the full range of human hearing. Of special note are the pedal notes - tracker organs have low-pressure pipes and don't typically produce the kind of impact around 30-35 hz that modern organs do. A headphone that's lacking even a little in the low bass will sound especially bass-shy with this type of organ, but the HD-280 delivers the full experience of this music.Jamming With Edward - It Hurts Me Too (1969): Intended originally as a test to fill studio down time and set recording levels etc., this was released a few years later for hardcore Rolling Stones fans. Although not as good technically in every aspect as the Chess studio recordings of 1964, and in spite of the non-serious vocals by Mick Jagger, this rates very high on my list of white blues recordings, and sounds absolutely delicious with the HD-280.Jennifer Warnes - Rock You Gently (1992?): The strong deep bass percussion at the beginning of this track has been cited as a test for weakness or distortion in certain headphones. The HD-280 plays those notes with good impact and control. Having played this track a number of times now, I'm highly impressed with the HD-280's bass reproduction and detail throughout the track.Jimmy Smith - Basin Street Blues (early 60's): This track has some loud crescendos of brass and other instruments that don't sound clean and musical on some headphones. The HD-280 provides very good reproduction. Listen particularly to the second crescendo at 15 seconds in, for maximum detail effect. I'd like to emphasize that these crescendos are probably the worst-case test I have for instrumental separation and detail, and the HD-280 plays them well.Ladytron - Destroy Everything You Touch (~2009): Featured in The September Issue, this song has heavy overdub and will sound a bit muddy on some headphones. Sounds good with the HD-280.Milt Jackson/Wes Montgomery - Delilah (Take 3) (1962): The vibraphone is heavily dependent on harmonics to sound right, and the HD-280 plays it very well.Pink Floyd/Dark Side of the Moon - Speak To Me (1973): Strong deep bass impacts will be heard and felt here.Rolling Stones - Stray Cat Blues (1968): Dirty, gritty blues that very few white artists could match. On some headphones the vocals and guitar lack the edge and fall more-or-less flat. If you're a really good person, playing this song will probably make you feel nervous and uneasy.Tony Bennett - I Left My Heart In San Francisco (1962): Frank Sinatra's favorite singer. Highest recommendation. With some of the best headphones, the sibilants on this recording are very strong, but they're not bad with the HD-280.",4.0,Sennheiser HD-280 Pro Stereo Headphone Review by Dale (update 10 December 2013),1381276800,"10 9, 2013","Sources: iPhone4 alone, iPhone4 with PA2V2 using LOD, various computers using Audioengine D1 DAC and the D1's headphone out.First impression: Very lean bass, slightly hollow mids, strong treble.

Handled very well here.Boz Scaggs - Lowdown (1976): Good sound quality - this is a great test for any nasality in the midrange. Handled well by the HD-280.Buffalo Springfield - Kind Woman (~1968): A Richie Furay song entirely, rarely mentioned, but one of the best sounding rock ballads ever. This will sound good on most headphones, and it sounds very good with the HD-280.Cat Stevens - Morning Has Broken (early 70's): A near-perfect test for overall sound - this track will separate the best sounding headphones from the lesser quality types. Nothing specific, except that almost any deviation from perfect reproduction will stand out with this track. Sounds very good on the HD-280.Catherine Wheel - Black Metallic (~1991): Goth with industrial overtones - I like this since it's a great music composition and the sound effects are smoothly integrated into the mix. This may sound distorted or mushy with some headphones, but the HD-280 renders the deliberate instrumental distortions clearly.Def Leppard - Bringin' On The Heartbreak (1981): MTV goth/pop/metal at its best - good ambience and high energy - the better headphones will separate the details and make for a good experience. Lesser quality and the details tend to mush together. The HD-280 plays this very well.J.S. Bach - E. Power Biggs Plays Bach in the Thomaskirche (~1970): Recorded on a tracker organ in East Germany, the tracks on this recording have the authentic baroque sound that Bach composed for, albeit the bellows are operated by motor today. The HD-280 plays the tones seamlessly through the upper limits of the organ, which cover nearly the full range of human hearing. Of special note are the pedal notes - tracker organs have low-pressure pipes and don't typically produce the kind of impact around 30-35 hz that modern organs do. A headphone that's lacking even a little in the low bass will sound especially bass-shy with this type of organ, but the HD-280 delivers the full experience of this music.Jamming With Edward - It Hurts Me Too (1969): Intended originally as a test to fill studio down time and set recording levels etc., this was released a few years later for hardcore Rolling Stones fans. Although not as good technically in every aspect as the Chess studio recordings of 1964, and in spite of the non-serious vocals by Mick Jagger, this rates very high on my list of white blues recordings, and sounds absolutely delicious with the HD-280.Jennifer Warnes - Rock You Gently (1992?): The strong deep bass percussion at the beginning of this track has been cited as a test for weakness or distortion in certain headphones. The HD-280 plays those notes with good impact and control. Having played this track a number of times now, I'm highly impressed with the HD-280's bass reproduction and detail throughout the track.Jimmy Smith - Basin Street Blues (early 60's): This track has some loud crescendos of brass and other instruments that don't sound clean and musical on some headphones. The HD-280 provides very good reproduction. Listen particularly to the second crescendo at 15 seconds in, for maximum detail effect. I'd like to emphasize that these crescendos are probably the worst-case test I have for instrumental separation and detail, and the HD-280 plays them well.Ladytron - Destroy Everything You Touch (~2009): Featured in The September Issue, this song has heavy overdub and will sound a bit muddy on some headphones. Sounds good with the HD-280.Milt Jackson/Wes Montgomery - Delilah (Take 3) (1962): The vibraphone is heavily dependent on harmonics to sound right, and the HD-280 plays it very well.Pink Floyd/Dark Side of the Moon - Speak To Me (1973): Strong deep bass impacts will be heard and felt here.Rolling Stones - Stray Cat Blues (1968): Dirty, gritty blues that very few white artists could match. On some headphones the vocals and guitar lack the edge and fall more-or-less flat. If you're a really good person, playing this song will probably make you feel nervous and uneasy.Tony Bennett - I Left My Heart In San Francisco (1962): Frank Sinatra's favorite singer. Highest recommendation. With some of the best headphones, the sibilants on this recording are very strong, but they're not bad with the HD-280.",Sennheiser HD-280 Pro Stereo Headphone Review by Dale (update 10 December 2013),2013-10-09,Sennheiser HD-280 PRO Headphones,,89.89,Sennheiser,Accessories & Supplies,Audio & Video Accessories,Amazon,2013,10,2,5026,0.9461596385542169,1,1,1.0,8316,0.2751067138744582,3.7563300354058433,3.0,1.4142135623730951,2,2,4.413793103448276,0.8667361346416775,29,29,Sennheiser HD-280 PRO Headphones ,253,106

I do not have lots of money to to put into my laptop for issues caused by shoddy workmanship or cheap parts.  So, rather than throwing good money after bad, I decided on a cheaper solution: external speakers.I obviously wanted one that attached itself to the laptop, as the ones that don't cost extra desk space, and become a problem should you want the computer somewhere other than a desk or table; a situation I find myself in frequently.As my headphone jack still works, I also wanted one that uses the jack, rather than hogging a USB port.  These do not exist.I also wanted a name brand.  Having had good luck with Logitech dating back to a Cyberman mouse-like device that is still working some 20 years later, and seeing the price wasn't out of order, I decided on the Z205.It arrived in good time, wrapped in Amazon-standard packaging (those plastic pillows), as well as the shelf packaging (shattery formed plastic better than the sealed kind it takes garden shears to open).  There isn't much documentation, but it isn't necessary.  What was there I threw away without a glance.  It's a speaker, what else could I possibly need to know?  I plugged it in the USB port, and clipped it to the top of my monitor slightly to one side, as the webcam is in the center.  Then I tried a program with sound.Nothing.  I was LIVID.

Awesome!But the included tripod adapter ( which a binocular this powerful demands) is useless, not rigid enough at all.Made my own from a bent bracket bar...you will need to as wellas the power of the optics negates being effectively handheld",Excellent viewing but bad tripod adapter,2013-04-13,Celestron SkyMaster Giant 15x70 Binoculars with Tripod Adapter,"Binoculars come in a wide range of shapes and sizes these days, and an even wider range of prices. It's easy to spend less than $100 or more than $500 for what may appear to be, at least outwardly, comparable models. While they may look the same, they are probably quite different on the inside.Recently, the binocular market has seen a flood of giant binoculars at prices that were unheard of just a few years ago. In general, giant binoculars are defined as those that magnify the view 10 times or more and have 70-mm or larger front (objective) lenses. It used to be that the least expensive giant binoculars cost in excess of $150, even $200. All that changed not long ago, when the bottom fell out of the price cellar. Now, several companies import giant binoculars that sell for half that, or less.Celestron's 15x70 SkyMaster binoculars are one of the leaders in the low-price giant binocular arena. They certainly sound good on paper. The SkyMasters include multicoated optics and BaK-4 internal prisms, two features that promise brighter, better images, and key points to look for when judging a pair of binoculars. They also come with an adapter for attaching them to a photo tripod, which is a must to use them to their fullest, and a soft carrying case. But just because they are cheap doesn't always mean they are worth the price. Would it be better to save up for a more expensive pair?To find the answer, I had an opportunity recently to judge the SkyMasters against a pair ofFujinon 16x70 FMT-SX binoculars, one of the finest pairs of giant binoculars sold today. Like the SkyMasters, the Fujinons feature BaK-4 prisms, but also have fully multicoated optics. As a general rule, superior coatings mean superior image sharpness and contrast. But then, that should be expected, given that the Fujinons cost many times more than the Celestrons.While the Fujinons were clearly the better performer, the Celestron SkyMasters held up admirably. Image brightness, quality, and contrast were all remarkable considering their bargain price. Although images were a little soft across the outer 25% of the Celestron's field, the overall view was impressive nonetheless.Some inexpensive binoculars have very sloppy focusing, causing the eyepieces to tilt and shift. Not so with the SkyMasters. I found that their center-focusing mechanism worked smoothly, with no apparently backlash or wobble. Eye relief (the distance you hold your eyes away from the eyepieces to see the full field) is stated to be 18 mm, a good distance for higher power binoculars and an important consideration if you must wear glasses when viewing. The SkyMasters are also light enough to support by hand for short periods of time, although buyers would be well advised to mount them on a sturdy photo tripod.The bottom line is, if you are considering a pair of giant binoculars, whether for bird watching, stargazing, or another recreational use, and have a limited budget, Celestron's giant 15x70 SkyMasters represent an excellent value. --Phil Harrington, author ofStar WareandStar WatchPros:Exceptional value for the priceLight enough to support by handBaK-4 prismsMulticoated opticsCons:Outer 25% of the field is soft and a little blurryRequires a tripod to use for extended periods",64.0,Celestron,Camera & Photo,Binoculars & Scopes,Amazon,2013,4,5,4847,0.9124623493975904,0,0,0.0,269,0.00883491611793124,3.5066261870884485,4.0,1.4142135623730951,2,2,4.0,1.2792042981336624,23,23,"Celestron SkyMaster Giant 15x70 Binoculars with Tripod Adapter Binoculars come in a wide range of shapes and sizes these days, and an even wider range of prices.

A2EV4250MPLXLK,B0002XRWRE,Kalaab M. Pickering,"[0, 0]","I purchased this camera because it was a close match to the digital camera I use (Canon T3i).  I love having a body which uses the same lens system as my main digital camera because it cuts down on the gear I have to carry.  One of my favorite features of this camera is its ability to read the coding on the side of the film cartridge to automatically tell the camera what ISO and the amount of exposures the film has.  Just pop it in and let it go.  The camera unrolls the entire cartridge after you load it and each shot progresses the film back into the canister, which is cool.  This camera also pops off an impressive 3fps in burst mode, and comes equipped with a handy backlight for the LCD panel.When I purchased this camera, my needs were specific: I needed a camera which could use the lens system I had for my digital rig, had auto focus and motorized advance, and was usable in the same way my digital camera was.  There was very little learning curve in switching from the T3i to this camera.  If you've outgrown your full-manual film SLR like I did (Mamiya MSX 1000, Vivitar V-335), consider purchasing this camera.  It can be had for a song, and since it was the latest 35mm camera Canon produced (2004, I believe) you'll probably manage to get one in good shape, too.I shoot about 50/50 with film and digital, and it's really nice to have such a modern film SLR.",5.0,A Modern Review,1397433600,"04 14, 2014","I purchased this camera because it was a close match to the digital camera I use (Canon T3i).

It has the latest automation, a ""souped-up"" selection of powerful features, expanded shooting modes and state-of-the-art E-TTL II autoflash. It's what makes the Rebel T2 the most advanced SLR in its class. A masterpiece of form and function, its luxurious design is both lightweight and ergonomic to make it truly user friendly. See for yourself, why the Rebel T2 is a camera that will change your expectations.Fully Automatic 35mm Autofocus SLRThe Rebel T2 gives you a full package of highly sophisticated automatic features that let you tackle even the toughest photographic situations - fearlessly. From the Mode Dial, simply select the Image Zone setting that matches your scene and the Rebel T2 automatically picks the optimal settings. Or choose Creative Zone settings for complete manual control.7-point High-Speed, Wide-Area Selectable AF with Advanced 35-zone MeteringThe Rebel T2 superimposes seven focusing points across the viewfinder for tack sharp focus automatically - even when your subject is off center. Or set your own focusing point using the Cross-Key AF Point Selector. You can also choose from three Autofocus Modes - One-Shot AF, AI Focus AF and AI Servo AF - to handle a wide range of subjects and environments with superior precision. The Rebel T2 also gives you the fastest shutter speed in its class - 1/4000 second so you can shoot as rapidly as life demands.To deliver the perfect exposure that makes unforgettable pictures, the Rebel T2 also has a 35-zone metering system. It's linked to the seven autofocus points so even when you're confronted with complex conditions, like backlight, you'll get superb pictures. To further refine exposure settings, there's an Orientation Detection Sensor that automatically determines the position of the earth and sky in your photo and makes the appropriate adjustments.Ergonomic Design with Secure Grip, Cross-Key Selector and Large Backlit LCDComfort counts when you're shooting. So the Rebel T2 was equipped with a secure grip made for one-handed operation. Better still, the Shutter Button, Main and Mode Dials, LCD Panel Buttons and the Cross-Key AF Point Selector are all within easy reach. You can even check the camera status in the dark, thanks to the backlit, oversized LCD panel.Safety Shutter-Release Lock and Camera Shake WarningWhen shooting is action-packed, it's not always easy to keep track of all the essentials. That's where the Rebel T2 shines. Its Safety Shutter-release Lock prevents you from shooting if you forget to load film or there is no lens attached. There's also a Camera Shake Warning that sounds when shutter speed is too slow to give you the pictures you want.Advanced E-TTL II Autoflash and Enhanced Built-in FlashEquipped with an extra-powerful, super-bright built-in flash and the very latest E-TTL II flash technology, the Rebel T2 delivers new flash precision. Using distance-based information, the new E-TTL II flash metering system automatically analyzes your scene and adjusts for variations in brightness, reflections and framing. This gives your pictures the true-to-life, even illumination that sets them apart from ordinary snapshots.Compatible with Most EOS System AccessoriesThe advanced design and superior quality of Canon's internationally acclaimed EF Lenses mean that they can keep pace with your ever-advancing photographic skills. Engineered for maximum compatibility, the EF Lenses work seamlessly with the on-board systems of both the EOS Rebel and EOS Digital Rebel cameras.

AUKZP25K3OBL0,B009XNBFJK,Mike,"[17, 19]","Is this a good tablet? Not really with my definition of what a tablet should be. iPad is a GREAT tablet, I think they have actually created my idea of what a tablet needs to be, which is light and very usable without a keyboard or stylus, App availability also makes the iPad ""easier"" and more convenient to use. For those who are now fuming because I basically said Apple invented the tablet. Do not be mistaken, I've owned quite a few tablets way before the iPad was even on the drawing board. One of my favorite TabletPC was actually the HP TC1100. I still play with it here and there to this day and STILL love it. Main problem with those told tablets was that they get really hot.With that said, the Surface RT is definitely a great device once you have mastered the features and the way it works, it's a longer learning curve, but don't let that stop you.(I'll start with the cons first). It fails as a good tablet for me because it is really difficult to use well in your hands. For example, I'm a fairly big man, with an iPad in landscape mode, I can type with my thumbs with ease, but the 10:9 aspect ratio here makes this impossible, thus I have to lay it down on my lap. Yes I know you can make the left and right key separate...but now the keys are way too small for my fat fingers! If you want to hold the RT in portrait mode, thumb typing is STILL awkward because of the weight! This thing is so tall that your hands will get tired just trying to hold it upright in this position.The app store is still a wasteland 9 months after the devices was released which means stuff like banking will have to be done from the browser. The kickstand is only useful in certain settings and depending on the surface it's on (no pun intended) touching the screen will cause it to move back slightly. The charger is not your typical USB charger, it is actually a somewhat large (1/3 larger then the iPad 10w/12w charger) power brick. The magnetic connector does not ""pull""/connect to the tablet's port the way a apple magsafe connector does. So you actually have to look at where it's going, 1mm off and it would pull in crooked and you have to pull it back and try again. I find myself hunting for the port a lot of times. The way the cable is made is also a bit annoying, I find that it puts a lot of strain on the cable because it's always bent one way or another.The PROS. keyboard cover is a godsend. Because of the 16:9 aspect ratio, the keyboard is wide and easy to get used to...and you really have to get used to that touch cover. It took me some practice and it's getting better. I prefer the TouchCover over the TypeCover for three reasons. I want the device to stay thin. I didn't want anything hard touching the screen. And I wanted the keys to be easily cleanable. The TouchCover can be wiped with a wet towel, I just wished the black one didn't have that cloth backing. The kickstand works perfectly when it's in the keyboard mode and I find myself using this tablet more like a laptop (on the desk) more than anything (thus, not a good table). The MicroSD card slot is a wonderful feature since you can never run out of room. Without it, I would've never bought this (I also would've never bought this at $499). Keep in mind that the 15GB left on your device is ALL THAT YOU HAVE in terms of app installation and system files. They cannot be saved onto the removable medias. The USB port has made moving files in and and out SOOOO much better than the iPad ever could have, and if you ever need to recharge your phone...you can plug it in this tablet. I don't have to worry about using iTunes and iPhoto and iWhatever! I'm an Excel power user and have found that having full Excel in this portable device extremely helpful.Last note. Unlike the iPad, you cannot just flip the cover OPEN and use the tablet because unless the cover is taken OFF or flipped ALL THE WAY around. The Surface knows a keyboard is attached so the on screen keyboard will not pop up until that hinge is flip past 180. It may seem like a small issue. But it get REALLY annoying after a while when you have to take that extra effort just to type in your lock code to check one thing.In closing. I think the RT is a perfect tablet-ish device for professionals and probably college students because it is a tablet for both creation AND consumption. The iPad is geared more for consumption. The only thing I wish the RT has is more apps. Having to go to the full websites and logging in via a browser makes this NOT a good tablet experience. If you have $350 (+$80-$120 for the cover, which I purchased on eBay) to spare and don't want an iPad mini ($329). The RT is a useful device for those who are not looking to play a bunch of games...16:9 is so much better than having black bars on your vidoes! Give and take I guess. iPad and RT both have some good features (sorry Android, never had experience with you) that can be very useful depending on where are you are.One LAST rant: the TouchCover retails for $119 and the TypeCover retails for JUST $129. That $10 difference gets you all those mechanical parts?!?!?!? I read that the cost of production on the TouchCover is extremely cheap/affordable and that they make a huge profit. They really should have had the TouchCover at $50 or so. I personally think what they charge for it is a slap in the face and plays a role in why the Surface sales suffered...especially since their ads/commercials/demos rely heavily on the convenience of a keyboard cover.",4.0,Great DEVICE.

A28P7V9KI7MXP,B004IY7F20,etcwhatever,"[0, 0]","I used a Meike battery grip on my last camera &#8211; a Canon Rebel T3i &#8211; and was sufficiently impressed with the quality of the unit to order one for my 60D.The first thing you should understand is that adding a battery grip to your 60D will make it much larger and heavier.  The 60D uses heavier, higher-capacity batteries than cameras like the T3i and T4i, so the weight adds up.  It's by no means unwieldy &#8211; in fact, the extra weight will help balance the camera if you use a long lens &#8211; but be aware that it will make an impact.  If you need to carry the camera with this grip around a lot, you'll probably want to invest in a good strap (I'd recommend a sling or holster style, to take the weight off your neck).About the grip itself &#8211; on my Rebel T3i, the battery grip almost perfectly matched the plastic body and rubber grip of the camera.  The 60D has a higher overall build quality than the Rebel line, but Meike's battery grip seems to be made of the same materials.  That means that there is a subtle difference in the look and feel of the plastic and rubber &#8211; the grips on the battery pack feel slightly softer and the plastic is a little shinier.  It is a very subtle difference and if you don't examine the grip closely, you'd never notice, but there is a slight difference.  There is also the somewhat strange fact that (as other reviewers have noted) the wheel used to lock down the grip still has a small amount of play in it after the grip has been tightened.  This does not affect the usability of the grip in the slightest &#8211; it stays firmly attached &#8211; but, along with the aforementioned difference in materials, it gives the impression that the grip is not quite of the same quality as the camera itself.Note that these are extremely minor issues and I am incredibly happy with this grip overall.  It is very affordable and totally functional.  If you want a grip that exactly matches the fit and finish of the 60D, your best bet is to buy Canon's.  That is absolutely not worth three to four times the price of this grip, as far as I'm concerned, but it's something you want to consider.  I would also encourage casual buyers to consider whether they want to add a battery grip at all &#8211; the 60D gets wonderful battery life already and the grip does add bulk.  I shoot a lot of video (and like a big grip on my cameras anyway), so it's worth it for me &#8211; but it probably isn't for everyone.If you do decide this grip is for you, I'd recommend Wasabi brand batteries &#8211; they are higher capacity than Canon's and come in a two-pack with a charger.",4.0,"A great value, almost perfect",1373846400,"07 15, 2013","I used a Meike battery grip on my last camera – a Canon Rebel T3i – and was sufficiently impressed with the quality of the unit to order one for my 60D.The first thing you should understand is that adding a battery grip to your 60D will make it much larger and heavier.

Furthermore, the BG-E9 provides full vertical shooting controls, which can be independently turned on or off as the photographer needs to enhance camera handling, especially for shooting vertical pictures.In addition, the BG-E9 features a shutter button, control dial, AE FE Lock, exposure compensation and AF point selection buttons for use in the vertical/portrait orientation.Package Content:1X BG-E9 Battery Grip1X Manual",748,3029

With the Belkin Mini Surge Protector you no longer have to choose what to charge first.This surge protector acts as a power strip, letting you plug three AC devices into a single wall outlet. It is rated to handle 918 Joules and provides protection against power surges and spikes, since the smart traveler is looking for protection of essential gear and irreplaceable data, not just extra outlets.Two Powered USB Outlets Let You Charge More Devices EasilyIn addition to its three AC outlets, this surge protector features two protected, powered USB outlets, so you can easily charge your iPod along with other USB devices. These USB outlets do not transmit data and the surge protector cannot be used as a hub, but they do make it exceptionally easy to keep devices that are charged via USB interfaces up and running without blocking your computer's USB ports or the AC outlets that you need for bigger devices.Plus you may be able to leave long, tangle-friendly cords and clunky item-specific chargers at home, since this mini surge protector comes with a mini-USB cable. This is especially convenient now that many phones, including Blackberries and Motorola RAZR phones, feature USB power connections.Unique, Efficient Design with Rotating Plug for Added VersatilityIts compact, lightweight, and efficient design means that you can easily slip this mini surge protector into your laptop bag or carry-on, and because Belkin knows that working on the road often means trying to plug in despite awkward outlet or furniture positioning, a 360-degree rotating plug with four locking positions makes it easy to use this device in tight spaces.About Belkin International, Inc.Belkin offers a diverse product mix that provides people with seamless electronics integration in their homes, cars, and on the go.

Featuring three protected AC outlets, two protected, powered USB outlets, and a unique rotating plug design that lets you work in tight spaces, this compact surge protector lets you plug in and charge all your essential devices wherever you are.Mini Surge Protector/Dual USB ChargerAt a Glance:3 AC outlets and 2 powered USB portsComplete protection on all outlets360-degree rotating plug with 4 locking positionsIncludes mini-USB cable for charging phones, MP3 players, and other devicesLifetime Product and $75,000 Connected Equipment WarrantiesYou can easily slip this mini surge protector into your laptop bag or carry-on.Includes mini-USB cable for charging phones, MP3 players, and other devices.Convenient, Dependable Design for Worry-Free TravelHotel rooms, airport terminals, and coffee shops never seem to have enough power outlets to handle all your devices at once. With the Belkin Mini Surge Protector you no longer have to choose what to charge first.This surge protector acts as a power strip, letting you plug three AC devices into a single wall outlet. It is rated to handle 918 Joules and provides protection against power surges and spikes, since the smart traveler is looking for protection of essential gear and irreplaceable data, not just extra outlets.Two Powered USB Outlets Let You Charge More Devices EasilyIn addition to its three AC outlets, this surge protector features two protected, powered USB outlets, so you can easily charge your iPod along with other USB devices. These USB outlets do not transmit data and the surge protector cannot be used as a hub, but they do make it exceptionally easy to keep devices that are charged via USB interfaces up and running without blocking your computer's USB ports or the AC outlets that you need for bigger devices.Plus you may be able to leave long, tangle-friendly cords and clunky item-specific chargers at home, since this mini surge protector comes with a mini-USB cable. This is especially convenient now that many phones, including Blackberries and Motorola RAZR phones, feature USB power connections.Unique, Efficient Design with Rotating Plug for Added VersatilityIts compact, lightweight, and efficient design means that you can easily slip this mini surge protector into your laptop bag or carry-on, and because Belkin knows that working on the road often means trying to plug in despite awkward outlet or furniture positioning, a 360-degree rotating plug with four locking positions makes it easy to use this device in tight spaces.About Belkin International, Inc.Belkin offers a diverse product mix that provides people with seamless electronics integration in their homes, cars, and on the go.

The Black Edition is a bit more money but has more shooting options and currently is the flagship of the GoPro camera's. I own traditional cameras (DSLR, point and shoot, video, etc.) but with a GoPro you can actually ""have fun"" with. There's no being careful with it because you can be tough with it and can take it into anything you can't take traditional cameras into (underwater, etc.). The fact you can mount it on different things makes it very unique. There are other action cams but GoPro right now is the highest rated and most popular. I read recently that TV shows and commercials (probably movies to for that matter) are now being shot with GoPro's...so go figure. I'm not an action junky by no means but I bike ride occasionally but use this mainly for family weekend getaways, vacations, in the backyard, and most importantly making memories (from a non traditional camera standpoint) with my 1 year old daughter. If you have kids, having a GoPro is great to have because even the kids can play with it.If you have the money get the Hero3+ Black Edition, otherwise there is the silver and white editions to save some money.

Thus here I am again and this HDMI cable does not disappoint.The only very minor issue I had with one of these cables was connecting a HDMI output on a video card to a TV. The heavy plastic around the connector was a tight fit where the plug was on the computer. To be fair the plate the plug was in was slightly recessed which seems the root of the issue.For making a product that is of premium quality at a bargain price I give the BlueRigger HDMI cable 5 stars.Update: February 26, 2014I had one of my cables get bent. Not the cable, the metal part of the connector. About 30 degrees off straight and the cable stopped working.

Featuring a class-leading 18.0-megapixel CMOS image sensor and increased light sensitivity for low light photography, the EOS Rebel T2i also has an advanced HD Movie mode for gorgeous Full HD movies. Able to capture up to 3.7 frames per second, it's ready to go the minute it's picked up. Advanced Live View, a new wide-area screen, plus features like Canon's brilliant Auto Lighting Optimizer and Highlight Tone features ensure brilliant photos and movies, easily. With some of the most advanced features of any digital SLR, it's simply the best Rebel Canon has ever created.EOS Rebel T2i Highlights18.0-megapixel CMOS (APS-C) sensor and DIGIC 4 Image ProcessorThe EOS Rebel T2i has an 18.0-megapixel CMOS sensor that captures images with exceptional clarity and tonal range and offers more than enough resolution for big enlargements or crops. This first-class sensor features many of the same new technologies as used by professional Canon cameras to maximize each pixel's light-gathering efficiency. Its APS-C size sensor creates an effective 1.6x field of view (compared to 35mm format).DIGIC 4 Image ProcessorThe Canon DIGIC 4 Image Processor dramatically speeds up the entire EOS Rebel T2i's camera operations for intuitive operation and offers improvements in both fine detail and natural color reproduction. It works in concert with the EOS Rebel T2i's CMOS Image Sensor to achieve phenomenal levels of performance in nearly any situation.Capture stunning shots in low light.ISO 100-6400 (expandable to 12800) for shooting from bright to dim lightThe EOS Rebel T2i features an expanded ISO range that makes shooting possible in situations previously unthinkable without flash. With an ISO rating up to 6400 (expandable to ISO 12800), along with the DIGIC 4 Image Processor's improved noise-reduction technology, creative possibilities abound. Combine the EOS Rebel T2i with one of Canon's EF or EF-S lenses with Optical Image Stabilizer and the shooting possibilities for both movies and stills expand even further.Improved EOS Movie mode with manual exposure controlDesigned for the evolving, tech-savvy user, the EOS Rebel T2i features HD Video capture technologies--manual exposure control for more creative control, for example--borrowed directly from professional Canon SLRs to capture stellar video with all the benefits of shooting with an SLR. By shooting video with the EOS Rebel T2i, photographers as well as filmmakers can take advantage of the creative features native to SLR cameras. Along with its manual controls, the EOS Rebel T2i allows for full use of Canon EF and EF-S lenses, including Macro and Fisheye, providing a plethora of shooting options once reserved only for still photography. The resulting HD video is a standout in its beautiful depth-of-field characteristics and remarkable capture capability under poor lighting conditions. In a first for EOS cameras, a Movie Crop function is included: An SD-quality movie (640 x 480) can be cropped to the equivalent of about 7x magnification of regular shooting.Video can be captured at a number of resolutions and frame rates for numerous applications. It can capture 1920 x 1080 Full HD video at frame rates of 24 (23.976), 25 or 30 (29.97) frames per second, for up to 4GB per clip. Movies are saved as MOV files and can be viewed in Full HD through the EOS Rebel T2i's HDMI output. Other recording sizes include HD at 1280 x 720 (50/60 (59.94) fps) or SD/VGA at 640 x 480 (50/60 (59.94) fps). The EOS Rebel T2i has a built-in microphone for simple mono recording and stereo sound can be recorded through a self-powered external microphone.Enhanced 63-zone, Dual-layer metering system, and 9-point AF systemThe EOS Rebel T2i features Canon's newest Dual-layer sensor, with 63-zones. By measuring not only the amount of light, but also taking into account color and luminosity, this new system delivers a very high level of accuracy for better results every time. Since the metering sensor has a color measurement function, exposure errors and focus errors caused by different light sources are minimized; the EOS Rebel T2i gives stable exposure from shot to shot in situations where light changes, such as sports on a cloudy day, or indoor holiday scenes.Additionally, the EOS Rebel T2i has a high-precision, 9-point AF system utilizing a high-precision, f/2.8 cross-type center point. The 9-point AF system uses both normal and high-precision focus depending on the aperture and available light. The 9 focus points can be chosen automatically or manually selected.Wide 3.0-inch (3:2 aspect ratio) Clear View LCD monitorThe EOS Rebel T2i has a high-resolution 3.0-inch Clear View LCD monitor that features 1.04 million dots/VGA for spectacular detail. It also has the same aspect ratio (3:2) as the camera's sensor, making for clear and easy Live View composition. An anti-reflective and water-repellant coating provides a clearer and more smudge-resistant surface and screen brightness can be adjusted in 7 steps in accordance with ambient light.New Quick Control Screen buttonThe EOS Rebel T2i's refined button layout includes a dedicated button that directs the camera immediately to the Quick Control screen, where it's simple to navigate among any number of settings, including ISO, Exposure and Flash Exposure compensation, drive mode, white balance, image quality and much, much more.Improved layout with dedicated Live View/Movie shooting buttonWithout the need to navigate through a bunch of menus, the EOS Rebel T2i transitions effortlessly between still and movie mode. By pressing the Live View/Movie button, a situation that had required menu access with other cameras, still images can change to a movie shoot and vice versa. It's literally as simple as the press of a button.3.7fps continuous shooting up to approximately 34 JPEGs or approximately 6 RAWThe EOS Rebel T2i can shoot up to 3.7 frames per second (fps) for up to approximately 6 consecutive RAW files or approximately 34 full-resolution JPEGs. Shooting at speeds of up to 1/4000 sec., the EOS Rebel T2i can capture even rapidly-unfolding scenes with ease.New compatibility with SDXC memory cardsThe EOS Rebel T2i is compatible with both SDXC memory cards for greater storage capacity and with Eye-Fi SD cards, which are outfitted with a Wi-Fi transmitter (IEEE 802.11b/g) and internal antenna for wireless, high speed transfer of images. With an Eye-Fi card installed, the EOS Rebel T2i can display the Eye-Fi's connection status and error notes with ease, for fully functional wireless uploading of images directly from the camera.*Canon cameras are not guaranteed to support Eye-Fi card functions, including wireless transfer. In case of an issue with the Eye-Fi card, please consult with the card manufacturer. The use of Eye-Fi cards may not be available outside the United States and Canada, please contact the card manufacturer for territory availability.Compatible with the full line of Canon EF and EF-S lensesEF LensesThe EOS Rebel T2i is compatible with all Canon lenses in the EF lineup, including compact and lightweight EF-S lenses, ranging from ultra-wide angle to super telephoto lenses. Canon lenses employ advanced optical expertise and micron-precision engineering to deliver outstanding performance and deliver beautiful results. Special technologies like the Canon Image Stabilizer technology in select lenses helps to minimize the effect of camera shake, effectively adding up to four stops of light. With a dizzying array of lenses perfect for travel, sports, still life and everything in between, photographers can truly maximize the quality and performance of their EOS Rebel T2i with superlative Canon optics.SoftwareCanon EOS Digital Solution Disk (Version 22.0)The EOS Rebel T2i comes bundled with a Canon EOS Digital Solution Disk, which features powerful software programs designed to extend the EOS experience to the computer.

In a first for EOS cameras, a Movie Crop function is included: An SD-quality movie (640 x 480) can be cropped to the equivalent of about 7x magnification of regular shooting.Video can be captured at a number of resolutions and frame rates for numerous applications. It can capture 1920 x 1080 Full HD video at frame rates of 24 (23.976), 25 or 30 (29.97) frames per second, for up to 4GB per clip. Movies are saved as MOV files and can be viewed in Full HD through the EOS Rebel T2i's HDMI output. Other recording sizes include HD at 1280 x 720 (50/60 (59.94) fps) or SD/VGA at 640 x 480 (50/60 (59.94) fps). The EOS Rebel T2i has a built-in microphone for simple mono recording and stereo sound can be recorded through a self-powered external microphone.Enhanced 63-zone, Dual-layer metering system, and 9-point AF systemThe EOS Rebel T2i features Canon's newest Dual-layer sensor, with 63-zones. By measuring not only the amount of light, but also taking into account color and luminosity, this new system delivers a very high level of accuracy for better results every time. Since the metering sensor has a color measurement function, exposure errors and focus errors caused by different light sources are minimized; the EOS Rebel T2i gives stable exposure from shot to shot in situations where light changes, such as sports on a cloudy day, or indoor holiday scenes.Additionally, the EOS Rebel T2i has a high-precision, 9-point AF system utilizing a high-precision, f/2.8 cross-type center point. The 9-point AF system uses both normal and high-precision focus depending on the aperture and available light. The 9 focus points can be chosen automatically or manually selected.Wide 3.0-inch (3:2 aspect ratio) Clear View LCD monitorThe EOS Rebel T2i has a high-resolution 3.0-inch Clear View LCD monitor that features 1.04 million dots/VGA for spectacular detail. It also has the same aspect ratio (3:2) as the camera's sensor, making for clear and easy Live View composition. An anti-reflective and water-repellant coating provides a clearer and more smudge-resistant surface and screen brightness can be adjusted in 7 steps in accordance with ambient light.New Quick Control Screen buttonThe EOS Rebel T2i's refined button layout includes a dedicated button that directs the camera immediately to the Quick Control screen, where it's simple to navigate among any number of settings, including ISO, Exposure and Flash Exposure compensation, drive mode, white balance, image quality and much, much more.Improved layout with dedicated Live View/Movie shooting buttonWithout the need to navigate through a bunch of menus, the EOS Rebel T2i transitions effortlessly between still and movie mode. By pressing the Live View/Movie button, a situation that had required menu access with other cameras, still images can change to a movie shoot and vice versa. It's literally as simple as the press of a button.3.7fps continuous shooting up to approximately 34 JPEGs or approximately 6 RAWThe EOS Rebel T2i can shoot up to 3.7 frames per second (fps) for up to approximately 6 consecutive RAW files or approximately 34 full-resolution JPEGs. Shooting at speeds of up to 1/4000 sec., the EOS Rebel T2i can capture even rapidly-unfolding scenes with ease.New compatibility with SDXC memory cardsThe EOS Rebel T2i is compatible with both SDXC memory cards for greater storage capacity and with Eye-Fi SD cards, which are outfitted with a Wi-Fi transmitter (IEEE 802.11b/g) and internal antenna for wireless, high speed transfer of images. With an Eye-Fi card installed, the EOS Rebel T2i can display the Eye-Fi's connection status and error notes with ease, for fully functional wireless uploading of images directly from the camera.*Canon cameras are not guaranteed to support Eye-Fi card functions, including wireless transfer. In case of an issue with the Eye-Fi card, please consult with the card manufacturer. The use of Eye-Fi cards may not be available outside the United States and Canada, please contact the card manufacturer for territory availability.Compatible with the full line of Canon EF and EF-S lensesEF LensesThe EOS Rebel T2i is compatible with all Canon lenses in the EF lineup, including compact and lightweight EF-S lenses, ranging from ultra-wide angle to super telephoto lenses. Canon lenses employ advanced optical expertise and micron-precision engineering to deliver outstanding performance and deliver beautiful results. Special technologies like the Canon Image Stabilizer technology in select lenses helps to minimize the effect of camera shake, effectively adding up to four stops of light. With a dizzying array of lenses perfect for travel, sports, still life and everything in between, photographers can truly maximize the quality and performance of their EOS Rebel T2i with superlative Canon optics.SoftwareCanon EOS Digital Solution Disk (Version 22.0)The EOS Rebel T2i comes bundled with a Canon EOS Digital Solution Disk, which features powerful software programs designed to extend the EOS experience to the computer.

It is widely used as a portrait lens to shoot ultra-bright & vivid portrait pictures. Rokinon’s 85mm lens stacks up extremely well against the Canon EF 85mm f/1.2 and against the Nikon 85mm f/1.4. It is also the least expensive lens of its kind in the market! The lens is manual focus and the aperture needs to be controlled directly from the lens, but at a cost of less than $300, how can you go wrong? The Rokinon 85mm lens is made with mostly glass and aluminum components and the build quality is superb. Its focusing is silky smooth with an internal focusing (IF) mechanism so that the physical size remains constant during focusing. There are little or no chromatic aberrations and Bokeh is just about perfect. The lens comes complete with a removable lens hood, lens caps, lens pouch, instruction manual and one year warranty. The lens is available in the following mounts: Canon, Nikon, Pentax, Sony & Olympus 4/3. There is also a slightly more expensive version (Model # 85MAF-N) for Nikon that features a built-in focus confirm chip. See the uploaded video that was taken with this lens.

It's easy to spend less than $100 or more than $500 for what may appear to be, at least outwardly, comparable models. While they may look the same, they are probably quite different on the inside.Recently, the binocular market has seen a flood of giant binoculars at prices that were unheard of just a few years ago. In general, giant binoculars are defined as those that magnify the view 10 times or more and have 70-mm or larger front (objective) lenses. It used to be that the least expensive giant binoculars cost in excess of $150, even $200. All that changed not long ago, when the bottom fell out of the price cellar. Now, several companies import giant binoculars that sell for half that, or less.Celestron's 15x70 SkyMaster binoculars are one of the leaders in the low-price giant binocular arena. They certainly sound good on paper. The SkyMasters include multicoated optics and BaK-4 internal prisms, two features that promise brighter, better images, and key points to look for when judging a pair of binoculars. They also come with an adapter for attaching them to a photo tripod, which is a must to use them to their fullest, and a soft carrying case. But just because they are cheap doesn't always mean they are worth the price. Would it be better to save up for a more expensive pair?To find the answer, I had an opportunity recently to judge the SkyMasters against a pair ofFujinon 16x70 FMT-SX binoculars, one of the finest pairs of giant binoculars sold today. Like the SkyMasters, the Fujinons feature BaK-4 prisms, but also have fully multicoated optics. As a general rule, superior coatings mean superior image sharpness and contrast. But then, that should be expected, given that the Fujinons cost many times more than the Celestrons.While the Fujinons were clearly the better performer, the Celestron SkyMasters held up admirably. Image brightness, quality, and contrast were all remarkable considering their bargain price. Although images were a little soft across the outer 25% of the Celestron's field, the overall view was impressive nonetheless.Some inexpensive binoculars have very sloppy focusing, causing the eyepieces to tilt and shift. Not so with the SkyMasters. I found that their center-focusing mechanism worked smoothly, with no apparently backlash or wobble. Eye relief (the distance you hold your eyes away from the eyepieces to see the full field) is stated to be 18 mm, a good distance for higher power binoculars and an important consideration if you must wear glasses when viewing. The SkyMasters are also light enough to support by hand for short periods of time, although buyers would be well advised to mount them on a sturdy photo tripod.The bottom line is, if you are considering a pair of giant binoculars, whether for bird watching, stargazing, or another recreational use, and have a limited budget, Celestron's giant 15x70 SkyMasters represent an excellent value. --Phil Harrington, author ofStar WareandStar WatchPros:Exceptional value for the priceLight enough to support by handBaK-4 prismsMulticoated opticsCons:Outer 25% of the field is soft and a little blurryRequires a tripod to use for extended periods",64.0,Celestron,Camera & Photo,Binoculars & Scopes,Amazon,2014,6,5,5281,0.994164156626506,0,1,0.0,190,0.006220839813374806,1.404665629860031,3.5,2.1213203435596424,2,2,4.0,1.2792042981336624,23,23,"Celestron SkyMaster Giant 15x70 Binoculars with Tripod Adapter Binoculars come in a wide range of shapes and sizes these days, and an even wider range of prices.

I personally don't believe they even sent it and yes there is a chance it could have gotten lost or held up by the post office but that doesn't explain the fact they couldn't respond to my message even though I sent the first one a week early I still waited until the due date which is plenty of time to send a quick response. Well my opinion stay away always read comments and if your still determined to give them a try make sure you go through Amazon to ensure you are covered with their A-Z Guarantee because chances are you will end up filling a claim on them.

Altogether the device is 6.5&#8221; x 5.2&#8221; x 1.3&#8221; inches; 6.4 ounces, which is fairly small for any device. Alone the receiver is 2.9&#8221; x 1&#8221; inches, and power adapter is 3.75&#8221; x 5&#8221;. The power adapter directly plugs into the cigarette socket, which is a great feature, considering most FM transmitters require batteries. At the top is a 5V/1A USB port, which is made specifically for phones and smaller USB devices. For larger devices, you are wanting a 2A USB port (or higher).The power adapter connects to a rubber flexible gooseneck pipe and a magnetic connection port which goes into the receiver. The receiver consists of the frequency control knob, next/previous buttons, a display screen, volume knob, and multi-functional button. Overall, the device is well constructed.The device uses the FM frequency from 88.1 ~ 107.9, which is basically the entirety of the FM band. This is one method to wirelessly connect to your device without wires. The other method would be attaching a Bluetooth receiver to the Auxiliary port (3.5mm female stereo port) of your vehicle (if you have one). Now, this is where you will get the debate of which method is better, which overall depends on the user&#8217;s location (see disclaimer in testing section). There are Pros and Cons to each device, as both methods may see some interference.&#9654; Set up1. Plug the transmitter into the car cigarette socket.2. Press the multi-function button about 2 seconds until the blue indicator light flashes.3. Turn on the Bluetooth function on your phone (tablet, or media player).4. Search for Bluetooth devices and select &#8220;MPOW&#8221;.5. If pairing is successful, the blue indicator light will always be on.6. Tune the car FM radio frequency to the unused FM station.7. Tune the FM transmitter into the same frequency with the car FM radio.8. Now you can enjoy your music through the car stereo.The setup process is extremely easy, but if you purchase MPOW products, then you will notice that every MPow product uses &#8220;MPOW&#8221; as their Bluetooth name. This will lead to major confusion if you decide to purchase more than one product.&#9654; TestingI will start by stating a little disclaimer. Because this uses FM frequencies, the experience will be different for everyone. More populated areas will result in more radio stations, which means the experience won&#8217;t be as positive as someone who lives in a rural or less populated area.The initial setup of the device was a little frustrating, because, despite the power adapter using a magnetic connection into the receiver, the receiver didn&#8217;t want to turn on. I was required to turn the receiver until it came on. Also, the position of the receiver always seemed awkward, as I was required to move the receiver to the right, potentially blocking the other cigarette lighter. I would have preferred the display and buttons optimized for the driver instead.The lights and display of the device are impressively flashy. It is almost like having a secondary display for your stereo. As said in setup, the device is fairly easy to setup, but may be a little frustrating with MPow deciding to name every Bluetooth device &#8220;MPOW&#8221;. For me, I used 101.3 FM as the radio station, which had very little static, and seemed to perform better in terms of volume and sound quality than my Himbox HB01, which also is in the same price range. I was overall very impressed by this product.&#9654; Final ThoughtsI think the cons for this device are minor. Purchasing this device means you know the potential  risks. This device is ideal for vehicles without an auxiliary port and requires almost no setup (beside Bluetooth pairing). My experience with this device was very positive, because the sound quality was superior to my Himbox HB01. I absolutely recommend this device to anyone needing such a device and give this product a 5 star rating.Pros:+ Uses FM connection, which means everyone&#8217;s experience will be different. My experience was extremely positive.+ Absolutely no wires required, unlike similar car kits that require auxiliary input.+ Impressively flashy interface.+ Doesn&#8217;t require batteries and includes a USB port.+ Same cost as Bluetooth adapter with auxiliary port.Cons:- Uses FM connection, which means everyone&#8217;s experience will be different.- Despite using magnetic connection, I was required to turn receiver in order for it to turn on.- Every MPow product uses the name &#8220;MPOW&#8221; for Bluetooth, which will lead to confusion if you purchase multiple MPow products.- Display and buttons are optimized for the passenger instead of the driver.

Because of this issue, it also potentially blocks cigarette outlets on the right side (see testing, 2nd paragraph).I was provided a sample in exchange for a thorough and honest review.",Clear sound quality but other people may have different experience,2014-07-15,"Mpow® Streambot Y Wireless Bluetooth FM Transmitter Radio Adapter Handsfree Car Kit with Hands-Free Calling, Music Control, and Charging Port for iPhone 5S 5 5C 4S 4 iPod, Android cell phone, MP3 Players and other devices","Description:Mpow Streambot Y Wireless In-Car Bluetooth FM Transmitter unleash your cell phone, get rid of the shackles of cables.Multifunctional design, User-friendly design with Mpow FM transmitter, makes Hands-free calls, enjoy clear music, GPS voice navigation, charge your device all can be easily done ON THE GO.
